After the babies, I don't know but I'll tell you this the color would be strange It would be a dark pool. Frank (00:08:50) - It would be strange and I would be terrified and that's why murky water That's why people that give birth at home like the reason like Becca was saying she was like I would not want to do it because if something goes wrong you have a baby half hanging out of you and you need to just leave and And then what and then you have to get in the Honda CRV then you got to go into the Honda You know the toaster the driving toaster. You also have to put a towel down. Joe (00:09:12) - I assume I assume you can't even sit You need to lay down you sit down that baby's gonna come out looking like a fucking V. Oh, yeah Yeah. Frank (00:09:20) - Yeah. Joe (00:09:20) - Yeah, and that's what it that's what happened in that video They were driving on the highway And I don't even know who was filming because if this woman was filming that too, then god bless this fucking woman But I think the husband was filming and driving and then this woman is just like laying back and she's pulling a baby out of her Shit, that's crazy. Frank (00:09:37) - Yeah, but then you have a bait imagine do imagine pulling up to the hospital right the emergency ER Yeah, and then you open the door and you're like my wife has a baby That is connected to the inside of her. Joe (00:09:51) - Yeah in her hands. Yeah in my 2005 Honda CRV at 2005, baby I don't know. Frank (00:09:58) - I don't know. Joe (00:09:59) - It would be terrifying but like it all happened so quick. I had no chance to react.Frank (00:10:04) - Like we got there, she got- thank God, she got- the epidural because she was fucking hurting. Dude becca has a super high pain tolerance and, like she, seeing her in tears from pain, I was like, goddamn, like that's got to be some shit, isn't it a big syringe? No, I think it used to be the one now is like: not, that's not cool. It was like yeah, it's not that cool. I wanted to walk in like yeah, that's what I'm saying. The guy came in and he had a Pokemon lanyard on and his name was like: excuse me, he had a Pokemon lanyard on. So instantly I was cool. Joe (00:10:36) - I do, right, you off. I was instantly cool with this guy. Obviously I he's like: oh, you have a name for the baby and we're like, yeah, Ruby. I was like and instantly I was like we want to name her Charizard. But like his name was like dr hashemi or something like that, and I felt bad because he walked into the room like a day or two later and he still had the Pokemon lanyard on. Frank (00:10:58) - And that's how I remembered him and I go all ash Ketchum is here, but I didn't want him to think it was a play on his last sensitive and I didn't want him to, like, you know, give my wife like a shitty, you know fucking epidural. Yeah, yeah, you know what. I'm gonna stick this bitch in her. But Becca didn't see five, she didn't want me to watch. I asked you when, when we were talking about, like, preparing for the actual exit, yeah, she's like I said, I was like where do you want me? Joe (00:11:24) - And she's like I want you up here with me and I'm like, okay, and I thought they were gonna like put gowns on so we couldn't see what was going on down there. It was out and open baby. Oh, there was no blanket, no blankie. So usually in movies they have like a blanket that goes over the knees. Yes, and you can't see, not in this hospital. You saw, I did. I was looking at Becca and then my periphery. I could see it, and so I'm just like you know, like I want to respect her wishes. You know she's looking at you. No, Becca was just looking down. Frank (00:11:54) - You know she only she pushed nine times. It was one, two, three. She took a break. One, two, three took a break. One, two, three. Like seconds. It was one, two, three. One, two, three. I got it. And then on the third one baby was out just like that. Jesus dude, this woman's a rock star man. Well, that's not an expression. Yeah, smooth as a rock star. I said this woman's a rock star. I think you said smooth as a rock star. Rock stars are not smooth. They're notoriously quite sandy, rough. Oh, I would say the rough around the edge. Joe (00:12:36) - Yeah, I think said smooth, smooth as a rock. But the nurse said at one point she was like, if you want to see something cool, now's the time. And I gave a little look and I saw the baby's head coming out. What'd you see? I just saw her head coming out. It just looked like a head coming out of a human. Yeah, but like what? Like isn't the baby? The baby was very purple, yeah, super purple. Did it look like a brain? No, it looked like her head. Frank (00:13:02) - Like. Joe (00:13:02) - It just looked like her head like, just like smooshed a little, but like it came out perfectly round. Nice, thank God. Okay, knock on wood. I don't know why I have to knock on wood. It already happened, yeah, and she was very purple, screaming, screaming. Uh, no, she was pretty calm. She came out and she was like fucking hanging out. She was like sup, she came out. She's like: yeah, guess who bitch babies love to come out and shake. Yeah, well, they have no muscle, they are, yeah, they're full-on like weaklings. Yeah, they're just there. She came out, yeah, like like a jello baby, only a baby. Frank (00:13:37) - Fucking. Betty's spaghetti just popped out of my wife and then they have to like shove stuff in their nose. So, yeah, so they had to shove, they had to like quick. Yeah, they had to unplug him. Yeah, and they had to do it in her mouth. To turkey based him. Yes, reverse based, reverse based. Yeah, yeah, but it was fucking so quick, like you had. I had no chance to be like holy shit, like it just happened, did you cut the cord? I did cut the cord. Oh, that's a thick boy. Okay, hold on. Oh, okay, how's this happen? Right, so who's holding the baby? Joe (00:14:13) - So the doctors hold the baby and I wet, baby wet, just fucking covered in gel. Yeah, what baby? Yeah, yeah, yeah, a human gel, yeah, yeah, yeah, so and then, and then there's like a cord and it's leading to the inside. Thought the cord was gonna be like a cool color, it's just white. Frank (00:14:28) - Oh, it's very white. Oh, like these lights like very white, whoa, yeah, so the bit the doctor's holding the baby. Joe (00:14:35) - And I asked Becca. I was like are, do you want to cut the court? Frank (00:14:38) - She's like, no, the dad cuts the court. I was like, okay, and you, fucking slut. All right, they give you a knife or scissors. It's like scissors, but they're not like real scissors, they're like medical scissors. Joe (00:14:47) - So they, they're like hinged, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, those weird, hell, yeah, yeah. Frank (00:14:52) - And then you snip one snip, one snip. I'm a snippy boy, you can't be over there. No, no, no, because that shit was thick. Joe (00:14:59) - Yeah, she goes, she goes, you got to go hard. I'm like why she was all thick. Frank (00:15:03) - She said that after the doctor. She said go hard, sick or dude? I was ready to fucking bowl up and dunk on this bitch. She said you gotta go hard. Joe (00:15:11) - Yeah, damn, that's mad nerve-wracking I was. Frank (00:15:14) - I was like all right, snip, went hard, fucking bang, crushed it like a man. Joe (00:15:19) - What happens to the part that's connected to the inside, the placenta? Frank (00:15:25) - Oh, then they just, that's what, pull it out. They put literally, she was in there and she pulled it out. Joe (00:15:30) - She wait, who? She the doctor? Frank (00:15:32) - Oh, she pulled out. She's like fucking like lassoed the placenta, yeah, fucking like yanked it out. So they cut they. Joe (00:15:38) - And then they make the second cut, on the belly button, I'm assuming. Frank (00:15:42) - So they like, yeah, yeah, well, yeah. Joe (00:15:44) - So they like, they like cut it, like here, and then they like tie it with like a fucking like paper bag clip. You know what I mean? Like a potato chip clip, gotcha, you know, yeah, just fucking, just like clipping it like a thing of lays, yeah, and they're like the baby's just like chilling with that until it falls off. Frank (00:16:01) - It's crazy, this is so, dude, it's not, it is so no, and that's the other thing is like everyone we talk about like birth and it's like, oh, it's gonna be fucking gross, like, yeah, dude, when it's happening, it is so fucking. Nah, I believe it magical, yeah, I believe you that like there's nothing gross about it, right, you know more gel. I'm like yo throw this fucking baby in a pool of just fucking green liquid. Joe (00:16:25) - Yeah, yeah, you know what I mean. Like, just like juice is coming out. Frank (00:16:29) - You know, oh, it was green stuff, I don't. Joe (00:16:31) - I well, I think there might have been, because so the baby's- remember the name of the baby's- first poop: three, two one: Oh, maneuver meconium very close, you got the end, I got it. But the baby did that inside Becca. Frank (00:16:50) - Yeah, your daughter's shit in your wife. Yeah, damn, that's crazy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, awesome. So what happened? Joe (00:17:01) - They just had to like that's why they had to do the turkey base. So I assume, like some of like the stuff was coming out, but his baby came out, man, fucking, Becca crushed it. Frank (00:17:09) - Dude, yeah, I mean, she sounds like she fucking, she was smooth as a rock star, smooth as a rock star baby. She, literally that's gonna be March. Joe (00:17:17) - I have had like the ultimate existential crises over the last week: crisis, yeah, you're making it like you know, I have, like, I like and I've. I sent you a list of things. Frank (00:17:29) - Yeah, you did. Joe (00:17:30) - I sent you a list of things that I've realized in my short week, because at the time of recording, guys, it's been a week, seven days since my, my babe, has been into this world. Frank (00:17:39) - Yeah, so I have. I have a list of things that you sent me with no context, none, the first one. So at first I thought I was reading a haiku, mm-hmm. But then there was too many syllables. Mm-hmm. Joe (00:17:49) - I could was five, seven, five. Frank (00:17:50) - Oh, you had no idea, I don't know. Joe (00:17:54) - The first one just says: you have no control. Frank (00:17:57) - Uh-uh, you got none of what, anything, anything that you think you had control over in your life. Joe (00:18:04) - The baby now controlled. Right, there's no like, do you? Frank (00:18:09) - No, I try. Joe (00:18:11) - Honestly, I tried to do, like all of the nighttime stuff, like.

You guys can go check out right now. Yeah, no one's touching my nipples, especially a baby. Frank (00:18:29) - Yeah, but like yo, you think, like yo, if anyone's gonna touch those nipples is gonna be me. Joe (00:18:33) - Yeah, okay, it's like yo. Frank (00:18:36) - You think you want to go to sleep?

Oh, yeah, so how much I'm like. Joe (00:19:05) - So how was your first poopoo caca duty? Frank (00:19:07) - I waited about a day to like the. So at the hospital the nurses were like you know, they were coming in. Joe (00:19:14) - We stayed for a couple days.

There's literally no point for men on this planet fucking pointless. Joe (00:26:52) - Why? Well, during the birthing process, you didn't do anything. I did probably less than that. Frank (00:26:58) - I gave her the seed and everything else was done by this woman, right? She fucking carried this babe around for nine months in her womb, she fucking birthed it mm-hmm, and then she gives it life and sustenance. Joe (00:27:12) - Nice word, right? Frank (00:27:13) - I have no fucking. I mean, I'm there to help, yeah, and like by that definition, but like, realistically, if I wasn't there, my wife Becca would be fucking awesome. Joe (00:27:22) - Yeah, I mean, you have useless nipples. Frank (00:27:24) - I've, nipples mean nothing to me, right, you know my nipples are pointless, right, but like me as a whole entity, useless. This baby can survive without me. Joe (00:27:33) - You're your personal assistant now, basically, basically you're an errand boy, yeah, and like I and you work for for Becca and the baby- and I was talking with my brother about this and and you know, we I really do believe it's true as a as a man, as someone who is going to have a child, and this serious- like you need to be okay with the fact that you will never be first in your significant other's life, ever again. Frank (00:28:04) - And like I, like I went into that because Becca had a child when we started dating- yeah, but like then when having another child, like I'm number three now, yeah, at best you're, you're, I might even fall a little lower sometimes, but moving down the totem pole, there's no like I have, there's no point for me. Joe (00:28:26) - Like you need you legitimately as a man, and I believe this, when someone is ready- because they always say you're never ready to have a kid- but like you need to be okay with the fact that you will never be first in this person's life, their priority is going to be that child and not you, right, if a fucking and like same for Becca, becca's fucking second fiddle, third fiddle: you know earthquake happens. First one to get the baby me. Sorry, you're gonna beat her in a race. You know, in a race, absolutely. Frank (00:28:53) - You know earthquake happens. Joe (00:28:54) - I'm using her body as a plank to cross over a fucking crevasse, exactly. But she would do the same for me, right? Frank (00:29:04) - Well, for the baby, yeah, with you. Yes, the next one I have on here: tits are wild dude. Joe (00:29:10) - They do it all. Frank (00:29:12) - Tits are nuts. Joe (00:29:12) - Breast milk is actually a crazy thing. It's a crazy substance. It's like when the baby is like sick, it pumps like antibodies into the titty milk. Frank (00:29:22) - Yeah, and it just like gives it to like. Joe (00:29:24) - It's like tits can make, like it make milk.

I heard that like yeah, and like again men are useless We don't have lactating boobies. We have penises, but that doesn't do much Yeah, it doesn't do much. It gives come which sure babies wouldn't exist without that But but realistically like that's like you just walk away. Oh, don't don't do that Like just walk away don't do it again. Don't walk away from that one. It's fucking wild dude This baby is just like sitting there gnawing on Becca's nipples. Joe (00:30:20) - Yeah, they have a crazy amount of suction it's kind of the fucking cutest thing in the world to like that my that my daughter does is When she wants the nipple it's fucking She says she's fucking She's like a fucking jackal dude this girl loves tits.

Or, you know, sometimes, to be honest, when I know that I'm gonna be drinking that night, I'll pop one before I go out and then in the morning I have another one.

No, but yeah, so what the fuck are we talking about? Frank (00:44:39) - Beds. Olive oil. Joe (00:44:41) - Olive oil and beds. Frank (00:44:42) - And beds. Joe (00:44:43) - Also, I just wanted to talk to you about something. Actually, you sent it to me, but I definitely wanted to bring it up on the show because I think it's amazing. Frank (00:44:49) - I don't know which state it was. I don't know if you remember. Joe (00:44:53) - I'm going to pull it up because it might not even- Oh! Frank (00:44:54) - It was actually in Slovakia. Joe (00:44:56) - Yes, yes. Frank (00:44:57) - Because yes. Joe (00:44:58) - Because obviously. Frank (00:44:59) - Because yes. That's why. The reason why it was in Slovakia is because yes, but let's just, I'll paint the picture for you guys. Joe (00:45:06) - Police are giving credit to a woman for helping them stop a thief from getting away with a robbery using an unusual method. Frank (00:45:13) - So how did she do it, Joey? Well, did she tackle the man? Joe (00:45:16) - No. Frank (00:45:17) - Did she have a gun and hold him at gunpoint? Joe (00:45:20) - No. Frank (00:45:20) - Then what did she do? Joe (00:45:21) - She used her mouth as a gun and she performed a sex act on him. Frank (00:45:25) - Specifically, fellatio. A man walks into a gas station wielding a gun, robbing the place. This woman goes, I know how to keep him here and sucks him. That's what happened in Slovakia because yes. Joe (00:45:44) - First of all, listen, if someone, you know, I'm not going to, good for this woman, I guess. Well, I mean, hey, she's a- First of all, it's in Bratislava, which the only things that happen there are like bad. Frank (00:45:56) - Yeah. Joe (00:45:56) - You know, nothing good happens there. Frank (00:45:58) - Bratislava. Joe (00:45:58) - Bratislava. Frank (00:45:59) - But it was saying that like the, like I entered like a convenience store or some shit or like a gas station. Joe (00:46:03) - Yeah. Frank (00:46:03) - Not really like where, if I was to rob, I wouldn't go there. Joe (00:46:07) - Well, also if that place was getting robbed, what the fuck would I care? You know, like I'm not going to be a hero. Frank (00:46:12) - Yeah, dude. Take the fucking Doritos. Take it. Joe (00:46:16) - You want, oh, you, oh, you want the 30 bucks that's in the fucking cash register. Go ahead. Frank (00:46:20) - Yeah. If you're going to want to rob and make some money, you got to do it the real way. You know what I'm saying? Have a pyramid scheme and destroy a couple of families. Don't take 40 bucks from a fucking 7-Eleven, you dumb bitch. Yeah, baby. Joe (00:46:33) - Go use the white privilege that Joe was blessed with. Frank (00:46:36) - Absolutely. Yeah. Hack like cryptocurrency or something. Joe (00:46:39) - Yeah. Frank (00:46:39) - Dogecoin. Joe (00:46:40) - Dogecoin or something. Frank (00:46:41) - You idiot. Joe (00:46:42) - Yeah. Did you fart? Frank (00:46:44) - No. Joe (00:46:44) - Why? Did you fart? No. Frank (00:46:47) - Something smelled. Joe (00:46:48) - Go ahead. I'm sorry. Frank (00:46:53) - It smells really bad. Joe (00:46:54) - No, I don't know what's going on. Frank (00:46:56) - Um, no, but, uh, this woman, I, you know, I'm very interested in what else she's done in her life because if that's her natural reaction to a gunman showing up, what else is happening? Joe (00:47:06) - How have we not have some iteration of a superhero? Frank (00:47:09) - That was her form of arrest. Joe (00:47:11) - She is a real life superhero. She should be put on the force. That's what I'm saying. Like she has just unlocked a brand new crime fighting technique. Frank (00:47:20) - Because when you think about it, if you're robbing a place and some woman's really, really willing to suck you, you might stick around. You have to at least figure it out. It's a 70 30 chance that you're saying, and I mean, I, I, have you seen a picture of this woman? No. Joe (00:47:41) - That's the thing though, is like if I'm going in and I'm fucking, you know, loading up like shooting the place up and then, you know, someone comes up to me and it looks like you, yeah. Hello. Frank (00:47:54) - Oh, I thought you were going to say no to me. Joe (00:47:57) - No. Yeah. You're hot. Frank (00:47:57) - Oh, thanks. You know it. What if it looks like me? Joe (00:47:59) - Well, I mean, Frank (00:47:59) - well, what? Joe (00:48:01) - We're going to have to wait some options. How, how far away is the police station? Frank (00:48:05) - Things like that. Joe (00:48:05) - Things like that. Frank (00:48:06) - But I mean, this is just genius. This is genius. This woman's a superhero. Joe (00:48:10) - It is, but I don't think it matters what she looks like because this man is robbing like a convenience store, you know, where they're selling taquitos. I don't think his standards for crime or women is that particularly high. Frank (00:48:20) - What's the Slovakian version of taquitos? Joe (00:48:24) - Probably something made from like the stomach of a pig, like the lining of it or something. I don't know. Frank (00:48:29) - It is called sausage penis. Joe (00:48:31) - Yeah. Frank (00:48:31) - Yeah. Yeah. Joe (00:48:32) - Something like that. Frank (00:48:32) - Yeah. Something that has like a, like a name. Joe (00:48:34) - I don't know. Frank (00:48:35) - I just know that because yes, that's why. Because of, because of Bratislava, which also sounds like a delicious kind of dish. Joe (00:48:41) - It sounds like a good like dessert. Frank (00:48:43) - Like a Bratislava. Joe (00:48:44) - Yeah. Like what are you going to have? Frank (00:48:45) - I'll take the Bratislava. Joe (00:48:47) - Yeah. The Bratislava. Frank (00:48:49) - Yeah. Joe (00:48:49) - That's why I like it. Frank (00:48:51) - Um, and after this came out, um, there was a big push and a big movement in the movie industry for, uh, the Marvel cinematic universe to create a new, uh, superhero that fights crime side-by-side Thor, who we know as a God who has a hammer and will like kill you. Joe (00:49:14) - Spider-Man who swings through the city, very nice guy, charismatic. And then they're going to have this woman from Bratislava who's sucking off Thanos. Yeah. Frank (00:49:22) - Throat girl. Joe (00:49:23) - Or whoever. Throat girl. Frank (00:49:24) - Yeah. Joe (00:49:24) - Throat girl. Could be, could be. Frank (00:49:26) - Throat girl or. Throat woman. The mighty Felice.Joe (00:49:32) - Well, no, you wouldn't go more like a wrestler. Frank (00:49:35) - Yeah, the mighty fillet Yeah, but that's such an interesting interesting thing. Can you imagine for the bystanders like picture? Joe (00:49:43) - You're the guy behind the counter. Frank (00:49:45) - Oh Oh, and then you're like, oh what is happening? Like oh, oh, oh my god. Oh my oh Oh This guy went from fucking robbing the place to dappin up the guy behind the counter in a matter of seconds That'd be crazy man. This guy robs you and then just gets blown in front of you I think like if someone were to break into my house That's when I would start throwing my body at them to keep them around, you know I mean like please please don't don't take the TV Have me What do you wear to bed? Don't take the TV I'm wearing a fucking full-on button-down. Joe (00:50:34) - I take the hat off and everything that hat the fucking ball. Frank (00:50:36) - Why did people wear? Hat pajamas. Joe (00:50:41) - No idea. Frank (00:50:42) - No That has a ball on it. No idea What is and they were like footies to like grown-ass men were like footies to bed striped pajamas like prisoners and the head it had like The door on the back the button door the button flap you take fat poops in pants Yeah in theory cool in execution. Joe (00:51:03) - I got it. Frank (00:51:04) - So take the pants off assume a bad idea Just slide them down. I gotta assume people back then did such stupid shit Though the pajama hats is fucking dumb I'm pretty sure it was like a real thing that like in like the 50s Like up until then it's like men and women like a husband and wife slept in separate beds And it was like don't touch Don't touch them. Yeah. Joe (00:51:26) - Yeah, you know, they were all immigrants from Italy. Frank (00:51:29) - Don't touch them. Joe (00:51:30) - Yes Yes, and they have separate lamps. Frank (00:51:34) - Yeah. Good night, and they hit them at the same. Joe (00:51:35) - Well that we do that We like separate lamps, but do you shut them off simultaneously? No, you know, no I keep mine on to do stuff and she shuts hers off when she's going to bed Or do you guys always go to sleep together? Frank (00:51:49) - No, I'm a night out.
