Okay, you go on to Stitch fix.com, you fill out a style quiz and you tell them, I like this kind of fit. Here\\'s my sizes, here\\'s my height, my weight and my waist or whatever the hell the sizes that you usually wear. Do you wear a relaxed fit? A slim fit? You fill out all this stuff and then after you\\'re done with that, they start picking items for you. And I believe it\\'s monthly and maybe that\\'s that could change. But you get a box delivered to your house with about like five items and, um, you only pay for what you keep so you get stuff based upon what you would they think you would like. And then you go, okay, these this is cool, this is cool. And then you send these things back and it\\'s free returns, free shipping. And again you only pay for what you keep. So it\\'s really cool. It\\'s a way to keep your wardrobe nice and fresh. And right now Stitch Fix is offering our listeners $20 off of their first fix at Stitch fix.com/basement.
