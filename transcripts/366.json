But you get a box delivered to your house with about like five items and, um, you only pay for what you keep so you get stuff based upon what you would they think you would like. And then you go, okay, these this is cool, this is cool. And then you send these things back and it's free returns, free shipping. And again you only pay for what you keep. So it's really cool.
