Joe: [00:00:00] Welcome back to the base.

Frank: [00:00:06] Well, welcome back to the basement.

Joe: [00:00:09] Welcome back to the basement yard. How are you doing, folks? Come on, guys.

Frank: [00:00:20] You would think this stuff brings me joy.

[00:00:22] What's up?

[00:00:23] I've finally found it. I've.

[00:00:26] Wait one second.

[00:00:26] Go ahead.Okay.Gotcha. I finally found the thing that you could do that would make me not love you or happy for you. And let's do this. Oh.

[00:00:37] What's that? What'd you say? Something about love.

[00:00:40] You can't wait, can you? Okay, this is starting to get a little incessant. When did you get the. I have a lot of questions that you still have yet to answer. And then I have a lot of things to be upset about.

Joe: [00:00:53] Here's a question. Here's an observation.

[00:00:56] Why are you talking like you're drunk?

[00:00:58] No,

[00:00:59] You're really trying to be Tony Stark.

[00:01:00] No, no, no, my my jaw. This thing barely fits me. My jaw doesn't really move any. And getting this off my head is a lot of pain for me.

[00:01:10] Oh, well, guess, you know,

[00:01:11] Because I think it's made for children, but, you know. One second. That's not supposed to happen.

[00:01:24] We're like, oh, like where and how? Oh my God, There's a lot of joy coming from the fact that this is so painful for you.

[00:01:36] Oh, God, that hurts so bad.

Frank: [00:01:37] So we're just going to start. I'm just going to start it. I'm not even going to like. Welcome back to keeping it, Frank. Fuck you.

Joe: [00:01:43] What?

[00:01:44] Fuck you.

[00:01:45] My ears.

[00:01:46] Good.

[00:01:46] Can I have that?

[00:01:48] What is it called? Silver. Silver lining. That it hurts you so much to put it on. Welcome back. Keeping it. Frank. Ladies and gentlemen, one thing that people know about me is I'm a big comic book fan. Superhero fan? You son of a bitch. Yeah. And you bought this? How many days? I. My birthday's in two weeks.

[00:02:09] First of all, I bought that. Monks, monks, monks ago. I bought that from monks. I put that months ago. I bought it in March. Oh,

[00:02:17] Was I ever in the thought process of your purchase,

[00:02:21] Dude, Selfishness, bro, my ears are on fire. That hurt.

[00:02:25] Good. Fuck you. So what the fuck? You pay me like a fucking French prostitute?

Joe: [00:02:30] Don't. First of all, the French ones make tons of money, dude.

[00:02:34] Amsterdam. Amsterdam, Ian. They make money.

[00:02:36] Amsterdam is legal there. They fucking.

[00:02:38] They are people from Amsterdam called Amsterdam.

[00:02:40] Dutch,

[00:02:42] I think. Polish you might have. You're from Holland. You're Polish.

[00:02:46] You might be right.

[00:02:47] Indian?

[00:02:48] No. That's Indian.

[00:02:49] What the fuck? No. Like. Hey, I'm buying this. Do you want in on it? Hey, I'm going to get any chewing gum. You just a self-righteous piece of shit today. How's everyone going? Boy? Oh, boy. Mean, what the fuck? What? This is my.

[00:03:04] That wasn't a lot of money like everyone. First of all, I posted that video on Instagram, and then everyone was like, oh, dude, Frank's probably freaking out right now.

Frank: [00:03:11] I was I woke up to that very upset.

[00:03:13] People thought I paid thousands of dollars for it. I was like, dude, it was for. 

[00:03:16] People. First of all, Iron Man. Joe, add it to the list. Hello. Second of all, people have sent me listings like this motherfucker like, and they were like listings for like eight, eight, $8,000, $3,000.

[00:03:29] What is $3,000?

[00:03:31] Do the math.

[00:03:32] 3000.

[00:03:33] There you go. And I, I just need to know. I need to know. I'm going to just start throwing out numbers. Yeah, just just ballpark me know it was. It was a thousand.

[00:03:44] It was less than that. Dude.

[00:03:45] What? Yes. What do you mean less than that? Where do you get this off? Wish.com. 

[00:03:50] Etsy, baby.

[00:03:51] God,

[00:03:51] Will you get anything? Etsy.

Joe: [00:03:53] What else do they have on Etsy? Dude, literally everything you could buy like fingernails if you want on there. I mean, it's like you could buy, like, pottery and like rings and shit, but then you could also buy like, think animals.

[00:04:03] You might be able to buy animals on there.

[00:04:05] No. Like whatever. So like whatever, like southern white women put in their kitchens.

[00:04:09] I was legitimately like, this is how I become a supervillain. I've always said I was going to be a villain. I'm not a good guy. I'm a good guy. But like, if we're playing and we're playing games, I'm a bad guy.

[00:04:20] What the fuck are you talking about? Are you flirting with me now?

[00:04:22] Maybe.

Joe: [00:04:23] Are you trying to have sex?

[00:04:24] Well, you know, if you don't fuck with that on. Who the fuck are you, bro? If I had that, I would be making kids out the fucking ass.

[00:04:35] Dude, it really hurts your chin in there. I need to be able to.

[00:04:37] You don't need your chin.

[00:04:38] I need to talk.

[00:04:39] You need to talk during sex. You don't need to. I know you can, you motherfucker.

[00:04:45] No, I'm not going to talk through my teeth like I'm some fucking old timey criminal. Give me the money. I'm not going to do that.

[00:04:51] You should do that. That's absolutely what. 

[00:04:53] I like to have some jaw space. Can't go. Can't go down on women with that.

[00:04:57] Oh, yeah. Because I'm really sure you're after you being a selfish prick and not fucking getting me. I'm sure that's exactly what your Mo is. Just an unselfish lover.

[00:05:06] Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. I am an unselfish lover,

[00:05:08] Aren't you?

[00:05:09] Yeah. You're going to tell me you can't figure out how to get. 

[00:05:11] Your 19, though.

[00:05:12] No. Knock your teeth out. You can afford to pay for new ones. Knock your teeth out. Have that on. Just slip your tongue out.

[00:05:20] I don't know. I don't know if you can do that. First of all, you saw that thing malfunctioning at the end. That got me really fucking worried. I don't know if I'm going to put that on ever again.

Frank: [00:05:26] Oh, yeah. You'll just have to buy another one. Give that to a child.

[00:05:30] No, because I'm crazy with the kind of stuff like that. Like I don't like wearing rings because I'm afraid of them getting stuck. If that thing gets stuck in my head, I'm going to slam my head against the wall until it explodes off my head.

[00:05:39] I would pay to see that.

[00:05:40] Yeah,

[00:05:41] But actually someone else gave me this idea. Since you're just frivolously throwing away money.

[00:05:47] $480. Yeah. For for usually,

[00:05:51] Bro. $480 to the normal people like us is a lot of money. Okay. I'm sorry. We're not fucking big, big business, Joe. big podcast over here. Big internet.

[00:06:04] You're on a podcast, asshole.

[00:06:06] I am a footnote, you son of a bitch.

Joe: [00:06:08] And first of all, that's not the right expression.

[00:06:10] I think it's not. It's.

[00:06:11] Yeah. It's not. We're not talking about essays. I'm not talking about homework.

[00:06:14] No, but like, footnote on, like, history is just like I'm a little part of it. Like, you have built this podcasting internet empire. Oh, here we go. You are known across the world. There are people in Scandinavia that are like, oh my God, herp de derp de Joe. What? I think they hurt her. De Darby like that's the that's the Swedish chef.

[00:06:31] I think that's Sesame Street.

[00:06:34] Swedish chef.

[00:06:35] What are you saying?

[00:06:37] Swedish chef,

[00:06:39] Swedish chef,

[00:06:40] Swedish chef.

[00:06:41] Who's that. 

[00:06:41] From the Muppets.

[00:06:43] Oh, yeah.

Frank: [00:06:43] Yeah, yeah, you know Herbie, dude. Yeah, well, take it easy. That's what he does.

[00:06:48] That was almost offensive.

[00:06:49] Almost was. If you're fans of the Swedish chef.

[00:06:52] Okay.

[00:06:53] But you're just like, just you're a big podcast and you're just throwing away your money. So I have some other things that you can throw away your money on. And I want to just get an idea as to if you think that you actually will throw your hat in this ring.

[00:07:05] Perfect. I'm actually in a spending mood right now.

[00:07:07] Are you?

[00:07:07] Yeah.

[00:07:08] Good for you. I got exactly what you need.

[00:07:10] My financial advisor came over yesterday and we, like, went over everything, and I'm like, oh, cool.

[00:07:14] Did he tell you to invest in me?

[00:07:16] No.

[00:07:17] Absolutely not.

[00:07:18] It's not in there.

[00:07:18] Didn't do it.

[00:07:19] It wasn't. He didn't fit that in. 

[00:07:20] Fossils.

[00:07:22] Whoa.

[00:07:23] You could buy a fossil. 480 bucks. Are you allowed to own a part of?

[00:07:27] I think so, let's see if it's on Etsy. I mean, I know you could buy, like, cool, like like shark.

[00:07:31] No, no, no, they would have something that some, like, woman named Barbara would like fake make a fossil. Like I'm talking. I want a real dinosaur.

[00:07:37] Like I'll tell you right now.

[00:07:39] Can I buy a dinosaur leg?

[00:07:40] I'll tell you right now.

[00:07:41] Or an egg?

[00:07:42] You mean I don't know about eggs? You can buy a Spinosaurus tooth.

[00:07:47] Spinosaurus.

[00:07:48] Spinosaurus? Those are the big ones. The one in Jurassic Park three that killed the T-Rex.

Frank: [00:07:54] These are actually affordable. $59 US. 

[00:07:57] For one one tooth,

[00:07:58] One tooth,

[00:07:59] One tooth, $59.

[00:08:01] Um, dinosaur fossil figurine. This isn't real. A T-Rex tooth, $69.

[00:08:07] 69. That's big.

[00:08:09] Hello.

[00:08:10] Um, do you know what? Honestly, these are a lot cheaper than I thought they would.

[00:08:14] Wait, can I see this? This tooth?

[00:08:16] Oh, yeah. Yeah.

[00:08:17] Is it a cool tooth?

[00:08:18] Is it like a shark tooth?

[00:08:19] It's a sharp looking tooth. It's a big guy.

[00:08:21] Well, I mean,

[00:08:22] If you're if it's a Spinosaurus, the T-Rex one was like a molar.

Joe: [00:08:28] That's not as big as I thought it would be. I mean, that'll definitely take your fucking arm, right?

[00:08:32] Imagine like, 800 of those in that son of a bitch that'll fuck you up. I want to see, like, the big, expensive ones, like Big Buy.

[00:08:39] I want like, I want like a T-Rex tibia or fibula. What's it called? Tibia.

[00:08:46] Tibia or fibia? They're both there.

[00:08:47] Yeah, yeah. I want, like, a big fucking bone.

[00:08:50] Here we go. Uh, 50 million year old Eocene era fossil fish. Stone sculpture.

[00:08:59] How much? $4,000.

[00:09:01] I won't buy it.

[00:09:02] I don't know,

[00:09:03] Can I see it? Is it. Does it look cool?

[00:09:04] I mean, yeah, it's not bad looking. You could definitely put it behind me or. Or here's the idea that money. Just give it to me.

[00:09:12] Let me see.

[00:09:13] Not bad. Just a couple fossilized fish.

[00:09:17] 50 million year old fish.

[00:09:20] This is the stuff you could buy when you have money.By the way,

[00:09:23] I'll be honest with you. I wouldn't, like, never buy this.

[00:09:27] Honestly, I would buy it. 

[00:09:28] If I had, like, $4,000 to spare. That would be a cool thing on a bookshelf.

[00:09:33] You'd be like, yo. Oh, what is that? What are you into fish like? No, bitch. That's from 50 million years ago.

[00:09:37] Yeah.

[00:09:37] Act like you know about. 

[00:09:38] I'm into history. Yeah. Here's another 50 million year old.

[00:09:43] This is a rabbit hole for me, honestly. Because once. 

[00:09:45] Another one from Wyoming,

[00:09:46] I'll turn this into a fucking $15,000. There's more fish on there.

[00:09:51] Oh, we got about six fish on there. Right.

[00:09:53] Couple. Couple more fish I want to see, like, the big stuff.

[00:09:56] Wait, that's 60000

[00:09:58] 1500 oh oh. What is it?

[00:10:00] I don't know why you said 60.

[00:10:01] I just came out of nowhere with that number.

[00:10:03] Um. Let's see. I mean, I don't see any, like.

[00:10:06] Wait, what are you looking on Etsy?

[00:10:08] I'm looking on Google.

[00:10:10] Oh, okay. Cool. I was going to say there's no way anyone on Etsy has actual fossils.

[00:10:13] I mean, maybe you never know. I mean, there's like little fossils, like little boys that you could buy. Oh, shit. Here we go,

[00:10:19] Little boys. You. I mean, maybe on Wayfair. 

[00:10:21] That honestly might be on this list somewhere.

[00:10:24] I actually just ordered some some furniture from Wayfair, so maybe a child will show up.

[00:10:27] I'm sure you did.

Frank: [00:10:28] Um, they have like other ones in here. Like fucking like trilobites. Like those little like.

[00:10:32] You think I know what that is?

[00:10:33] Kabutops. Kabuto. I'm a knight. I'm a star. Think of those Pokemon.

[00:10:37] A clam?

[00:10:37] Yeah,

[00:10:38] Just like real megalodon teeth that I want to see. Wait, those are huge. That's gotta be the size of this table.

[00:10:45] Uh, this one is a six inch megalodon tooth.

[00:10:50] That's a pretty big fucking tooth.

[00:10:51] That's a big ass tooth.

[00:10:52] Oh, it looks like a heart.

[00:10:53] It does kind of look like a heart, but I thought fossils could be in there. Yay or nay? Thumbs up, thumbs down.

[00:10:58] Hell, yeah, I think that's. I think that's a slippery slope for me, because I'm going to get, like, I'd probably start off with that rock with like a fish in it and like, spend a couple thousand dollars on that and be like, all right. You know, like, I would honestly rather that than spend money on art.

[00:11:11] I would say art over fossils, to be honest.

[00:11:14] Well, I would do art, but I would be like, if I'm spending $4,000 on a piece of art, I would rather have a piece of like, this is 50 million years old, dude, that's fucking crazy.

[00:11:23] Oh, here we go, here we go. 180 million year old fossilized croc giant crocodile.

[00:11:32] That's probably like $1 billion for. 

[00:11:34] $150,000. Can I see it? Yeah, it looks sick. This. This would be cool.

[00:11:40] That's giant crocodile fossil. That's fucking wild.

[00:11:43] That's awesome. Would do it,

[00:11:44] I would.

[00:11:46] Uh oh. A Monoceros jaw from Morocco, $26,000. This is just the jaw.

[00:11:54] That's pretty cool, too.

[00:11:55] You gotta do that. But I don't know about $30,000 there, buddy.

[00:11:58] You wouldn't. You wouldn't spend.

[00:11:59] Can you get off this fossil website? Okay.

[00:12:00] All right,

[00:12:01] Move on.

[00:12:01] The next one, I had people.

[00:12:03] What?

[00:12:03] People?

[00:12:04] You could buy people.

Frank: [00:12:05] Oh, yeah, you can. 

[00:12:07] I what would it be? Dark. Dark web. Joe finally starts, you know.

[00:12:12] What are we talking about? Are we talking about trafficking? I mean, was this your idea?

[00:12:18] This was an idea that came into my head if I really wanted to ruin you. Although these human traffickers, they don't get ruined. So, like you would be a part of the elite.

[00:12:27] I think they get ruined. 

[00:12:29] If they get caught.

[00:12:30] Yeah.

[00:12:31] You ever see, like, movies on this stuff?

[00:12:32] Like, you know, ones trafficking any humans?

[00:12:34] They are, but not you.

[00:12:36] Right.

[00:12:36] Okay.

[00:12:37] I meant no one. Like no one on this side of the table.

[00:12:40] Well, no one in this room. Let's start there.

[00:12:42] Yeah.

[00:12:42] No one here that we know of who is in this room, by the way, come up with a better name.

[00:12:48] What do you mean?

[00:12:49] Human trafficking. I hear that, and I just think of, like. Like a crowd driving in Manhattan.

[00:12:53] Yeah, like a crowded club.

[00:12:54] Like, make it sound scarier.

[00:12:56] It's like human trafficking.

[00:12:57] Human shipping.

[00:12:58] Human? Yeah. Human packaging?

[00:13:00] Yes. Human packaging.

[00:13:02] This is not. 

[00:13:04] An island.

[00:13:06] I'd buy an island.

[00:13:07] You'd buy a little one, though. You don't. You don't have, like,

[00:13:09] Somewhere in, like, Connecticut or something, I don't know. Well, kinetic.

[00:13:12] Kinetic. Kinetic.

[00:13:14] Connecticut.

[00:13:15] Connecticut?

[00:13:16] Yeah.

[00:13:16] Doesn't have islands. I think the closest islands are like Fire Island.

[00:13:21] Well, you can't buy Fire Island.

[00:13:23] Why not?

[00:13:24] Because the gays would lose it.

[00:13:26] Or you can just preserve it for them. It's like a gay sanctuary.

[00:13:29] Yeah, I would buy a house on Fire Island. 

[00:13:30] Sanctuary, by the way. A ganctuary,

[00:13:33] You'd buy a house on Fire Island. How much a house on Fire Island go for?

[00:13:36] A lot.

[00:13:37] Yeah. How much?

[00:13:38] I don't know a lot. Can you stop googling things?

[00:13:39] I'm just. I'm curious.

[00:13:40] Have a conversation with me. It's a podcast. I'm fucking,

[00:13:43] I am.

[00:13:43] Can you just stop looking up fossils? You fucking asshole. I gave up the fossils. Yeah, quite a bit ago.

[00:13:48] It's a fucking. What's it called? Ask a. 

[00:13:51] Archaeologist.

[00:13:52] God damn it. I was going to say archipelago.

[00:13:54] That's a place I'm pretty sure.

[00:13:56] No, that's like a group of islands or something.

[00:13:58] Archipelagos?

[00:13:59] No, not a B, it's archipelago.

[00:14:01] Yeah. Aka archipelago.

[00:14:02] Archipelago?

[00:14:03] No. Oh, well, actually, no. That's right. I know I am. 

[00:14:06] Damn animal skins or furs.

[00:14:09] Not into it. Or pelts as they call them.

[00:14:12] I'm not really into the animal shit.

[00:14:13] You're not going to have, like, you know, like alligator skin fucking sheets.

[00:14:17] You know what people have that? 

[00:14:19] I'm sure they do somewhere holding way too much heat.

Frank: [00:14:20] But it's like the top is the alligator skin underneath is like, you know, just like 20,000 thread count.

[00:14:27] I don't know, like, I go to people's houses and sometimes they'll have like the, the, the cow hide and I'm like, this isn't even comfortable. Like, it'd be one thing you have like a fucking, uh, like a polar bear on it. Like, I wouldn't want that, but I'm just saying, like, careful. But I'm just saying, like, if you have, like, a polar bear thing on the floor, you lay on that and you're like, this is mad.

[00:14:46] So select animals like you don't want, like,

[00:14:49] I don't want any animals you don't want like sheep's wool.

Joe: [00:14:51] I'm not into furs. I'm not into animal shit like that. Like nothing at all. Gotcha. Especially like when people have, like, the cowhide rugs, like I was talking about. They're not even nice.

[00:15:01] Yeah. It's just for. It's just just to say you have,

[00:15:04] Like, aesthetic,

[00:15:04] Like all these people are like, oh my God, snake skin boats. I'm like, don't want those. I mean, actually I do hate snakes. So maybe the boots will be okay. Um, how do you feel. 

[00:15:15] About snake skin stuff?

[00:15:16] Yeah.

[00:15:18] Skin furs. I'm not into skin is probably a different thing. So.

[00:15:24] Okay. All right. Now I think. 

[00:15:26] Like, I'm not going to say that maybe, like, maybe at one point in my life I would own like an alligator boot, but I don't know. I don't think so.

[00:15:35] You don't think you'd go for the skin?

[00:15:38] The alligator skin?

[00:15:39] Skin. 

[00:15:39] Boot. Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

[00:15:40] Yeah, yeah. But like furs. No, no, no.

[00:15:41] Like mink.

[00:15:42] Yeah. Like I'm never going to, like, I could never put a mink coat. Fur.

[00:15:44] Yeah. You can't.

[00:15:45] And I'm worried about some crazy person throwing red paint on me.

[00:15:48] That's the other thing I don't even know. I don't think I've ever seen Peta activists, but they're like, they're. They're always with just red paint. Just like living the dream ready to go.

[00:15:57] They're ready to fucking, like, ruin your day. Yeah,

[00:15:59] They I would say that they account for most of the red paint sales in the United States.

[00:16:04] It's crazy with the Peta thing and the paint thing. Like, I kind of agree with both sides because it's kind of like, you know, I get it, like you spend a lot of money on this jacket and you're like, you know, whatever. And someone throws paint on it and you're like, what the fuck, dude? You know, whatever. But then the person who's throwing the paint, it's like, dude, you killed like 30 fucking whatever the fuck to make that thing. It's kind of fucked up.

[00:16:22] I don't know what you mean.

[00:16:22] Like, in order to make one of those fur coats, you have to kill, like, 30 fucking animals.

[00:16:26] Yeah, yeah, it's a lot, but they breed them. They mass breed them. Like, it's like. Oh, like, you have a mink farm, and it's like, who's really getting hurt here? You're actually probably saving.

[00:16:34] Well the animals.

[00:16:35] Well, yeah. Well, they don't know they're dead so quick.

[00:16:38] Do you think animals know that they they're going to die?

[00:16:42] We're getting into.

[00:16:43] But do you think animals know like about death? I think they know. Like something's not right here. Something bad's about to happen. Yeah, because they have animal instincts.

[00:16:53] Like they know they run away from. They run away, you know? Is that because animals that, like, like, get rid of their tail? Because they're like, oh, predator.

[00:16:59] Yeah. Keith had a lizard. Who did that? I'm sure he did. Yeah. He had a what was it, a bearded dragon? Yes. I would think they don't have beards.

[00:17:07] They don't.

[00:17:08] Well they kind of do. That's why they're called bearded dragons. They have spikes. Well, but I would think that they kind of are like, oh, you know, like something, something bad's about to happen. Their instincts kick in and then like, by the time they feel like they don't feel pain, they're just dead.

[00:17:22] Do you know what's crazy? And I feel like I've said this before. You ever see a giraffe give birth?

[00:17:29] I think I missed that one, Joey.

[00:17:31] Giraffes give birth to giraffes? Yeah, like a giraffe will fall out of a giraffe. Yes, and it's already like a full giraffe. Do you understand what I'm saying? Like, not a baby. Not like anything that needs to grow. It falls out.

[00:17:47] They do need to grow a little bit.

[00:17:48] Yeah, but they fall out. Boom. A giraffe also. Not only that, they're falling ten feet to the floor.

[00:17:53] Yeah, that's the problem,

[00:17:54] Baby. Brand new. Imagine giving birth on top of a small building, like off, off your balcony. And then your baby hits the concrete. That's what happens with giraffes.

[00:18:03] They're built for fucking height.

[00:18:04] Yeah, they got stilts on. But then as soon as they're born, right, they're fucking, they're they hit the floor, they get up and then they're running from fucking cheetahs.

[00:18:13] They're born giraffes. How do they know that? Out of the womb?

[00:18:16] Because in their mind, they've been doing this for millions of years where they're like,

[00:18:20] But how does it know that it's been inside of a giraffe?

[00:18:23] It's built into our DNA that it's like, yo, get up, get out, get out, get up. Go!

[00:18:29] Yeah, but like when we're born, there's things like we can sneeze and shit and breathe or whatever the fuck, but everyone can do that. But if you. But if I was born and then a fucking something was chasing me. What? I'm just laying there.

[00:18:46] This is the thing. This is the thing. I actually read a book about this when I was in college. It's called The Gift of Fear, where it's like we're born with instincts, millions of years of instincts.

Frank: [00:18:54] And it's like, maybe sometimes follow those instincts. Those animals are born to be afraid of things, and most of the time it helps them stay alive except for when they're killed for their skin and or fur. Then they're in big time trouble.

[00:19:05] Yeah. I mean, you got a big fat problem when you got fucking. I gotta run away from cheetahs. But now I got this fucking fat piece of shit. Who wants to kill me?

[00:19:12] The world. Time to go. Like time to run.

[00:19:15] It's fucking crazy, dude.

[00:19:16] It is, it is. All right.

[00:19:18] Yo, the animal kingdom is so ruthless. It's the kind of fucking they do. And like what they. I watched the show. I watched the show one time. Go ahead. For from an animal. It's. It was in Madagascar, right? Like the movie Madagascar? No, like the actual place. Okay. Did you know it was an actual place? Yes, I did okay, cool. So I was there, and this thing will fuck in a tree to fuck a guy.

[00:19:43] What kind of animal is this,

[00:19:44] A fossa,

[00:19:46] A fossa or fossa?

[00:19:48] Fossa.

[00:19:48] Okay.

[00:19:49] Um. And so it'll, like, find a mate and be like, bet, like, let's go up to the upstairs and fuck. So they're fucking. Yes. Then another one is like, yo, I smell pussy right now.

[00:19:59] Oh, they could smell the fuck.

[00:20:01] Yeah. Me, dude, they smell everything. Those things. So that someone's fucking in the jungle. Everyone knows it's smelling it, right.

Frank: [00:20:06] They have. That's why animals have very sensitive noses. For fucking.

[00:20:09] So they smell. They. He smells. He's like, yo, pussy's around, pussy is afoot. Pussy. You know, like animals know like pussy is a pussy.

[00:20:18] Pussy is a foot.

[00:20:19] So he'll go over to the tree and he'll look up and be like, oh damn, someone's smashing. So just like us, right? So we'll look up and be like, damn, Brittany's like getting slammed, right?

[00:20:30] Brittany and Steph.

[00:20:31] Yeah. So you're looking up and you're like, fuck whatever. So they're fucking like. And they fuck all night and they like scream in the night. Oh yeah. Like crazy shit, right?

[00:20:41] No. No respect for their neighbors in the animal kingdom.

[00:20:43] But what this dude will do, the one who's on the ground like, damn the fossa, he'll go over to the tree and rub his dick on the tree. Right. So leave his scent on the tree.

[00:20:53] So it's now his dick tree?

[00:20:55] No. So then he'll walk away. And then when they're done, inevitably they have to come down. What goes up must come down. Obviously, this is gravity. This is Isaac Newton, who died a virgin, by the way. By the way, people think he was gay. I just think he had a lot of studying to do. Um, so when this fossa hits the ground, she's like, she's saying bye to the one dude. She's like, all right, yo, take it easy. And she goes, yo, this smells like dick.

Frank: [00:21:16] It smells like good dick.

[00:21:17] So now it's like, yo, what the fuck? So then that's.

[00:21:20] I mean, we took those animal instincts into the real world. Think about it. You walking down New York City, you're hungry. Bacon, egg and cheese. Bang. Let's smell that. You go right in. Same thing. The fossa has helped us figure out exactly what we want to eat. The same thing. 

[00:21:34] Matt smells.

[00:21:34] Matt. I mean, dogs do that shit, too. Dogs would be like, yo, fuck this. Fuck your house. I'm pissing all over it. So girl dog walks out are like, oh, I smell another dick here. Yeah. Are you smelling.

[00:21:43] Yo, this smells like a very, like, dominating piss.

[00:21:46] That's a good. Yeah. Like in the animal kingdom. It's all about the power of your stench.

[00:21:50] Yeah. In that regard, I would be the strongest animal because I stink. I smell like a fucking dumpster crap. Yeah, like dumpster crap.

[00:21:59] You do. 

[00:22:00] I and I'm gross. Yeah. So in the animal kingdom, I would be high and mighty. Here in the human world,

[00:22:07] You just smell like shit.

[00:22:08] Just smell like dog shit.

Joe: [00:22:09] They actually like it if you don't smell. Which is weird,

[00:22:11] Because in the animal kingdom, going against our instincts. Joey.

[00:22:14] Yeah, you know what's crazy about the smells in the animal kingdom? I feel like they like it's it's like leaving a piece of your DNA, and then they can smell it and, like, know everything about you, like, know if you're a bitch or, like if. If you ever like bitten in the last few months. Like they know everything about you, they smell you and they're like, oh, this guy's a fucking.

[00:22:31] Well, think about it. I mean, it goes just like your boy Mufasa. Like, you know, when he's fucking rubbing his dick on that tree just like this. Yeah. I don't know why I think he's holding, like, the base of the tree. Just getting a good dick rubbing.

[00:22:43] Well, he was hugging it.

[00:22:43] He was hugging the tree.

[00:22:44] Yeah, yeah,

[00:22:46] That is a power play. That's a move. So when that girl fossa comes down, she's like, that's a strong dick. I smell like that dick I just got. Mm. Not bad. You know, maybe did the, maybe did the job. But now I'm in search of this Dixon right here. And big time power move. Got to say.

[00:23:05] Yeah. Can you imagine that? Like you like leaving your dick scent all over, like your your girlfriend's mailbox or something?

[00:23:10] Oh, I mean, in ways we do that I don't know if, like, I rub my dick on her mailbox back in the day, but, like, I definitely like my clothes are, you know, I leave behind, you know, like a pair of boxers, you know, and it's like, you know, someone walks in and they know something smells wrong.

[00:23:29] Horses. You want an horses?

[00:23:32] Oh, would I own a horse?

[00:23:34] Yeah. You getting into the like, Pat? I just pat some horses.

[00:23:37] Dude, when did you pat horses?

[00:23:39] When I was in upstate. There was a stable where I was talking to this guy. He had a handful of.

[00:23:44] But I'm not saying, like. Yeah, no, probably not. I'm not saying like, yo, like the cute horses. Like you'll have like a little dude ranch. I'm saying, like, you're owning, like the ones that you'll like.

[00:23:52] Clydesdale.

[00:23:53] They fuck up, kill them.

[00:23:55] Well, that's all horses. But I'm saying, like the ones that race, you know, like Seabiscuit. American.

[00:24:00] I don't want to race a horse. I just want to, like, have it, maybe ride it around my property.

[00:24:03] Oh, you're going to learn how to ride the horse.

[00:24:05] Learn? I just just get on that bitch.

[00:24:07] No, no.

[00:24:08] You know, you hire a guy who, like, feeds him, and he knows some stuff, and he's like, get on there.

[00:24:12] I mean, you don't just get on a horse and they know how to go and stop and all that, like, they need you.

[00:24:16] You hire a guy who's been around horses,

[00:24:18] You need to get spurs. You need to get reins.

[00:24:20] You don't need spurs. You need to hurt the thing.

[00:24:22] I mean, you know, they have thick, thick hides. I think they'll be okay. Yeah, but you could just use your heel.

[00:24:27] They got a lot of speaking of smells. They got a lot of smells, a lot of flies hanging around them. 

[00:24:32] That's why they call them horse flies. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're just like, oh, dude, that was another thing. So I was in the in the woods for this wedding. Yeah. And I'm talking to the guy who owns the property and he's like, yeah, I built this barn or whatever. Then he built like the stable that the horses are in and I'm talking to him. And then this fucking fly brolic dude. Red eyes, red like the fucking devil. Big fly lands on his arm and he goes, look at that. What's that? And I go, he's looking at the time. So I go, look at that. What's that? I'm like, it's a big fucking.

[00:25:02] It's a those things hurt man.

[00:25:03] Yeah. And then he just goes. What? Yeah. And he threw it over his shoulder like, dude,

[00:25:12] Horse flies will fuck you up.

[00:25:14] But also I was just shocked that this flied and fly away.

[00:25:17] Oh, dude, flies are stupid idiots. I can't even tell you how many flies I've caught in my life where it's just like they're just there, and I just. I literally have a picture. I have a picture of me catching a fly that's how fucking. 

[00:25:28] By its wings.

[00:25:29] Look at this picture.

[00:25:30] What are you, Bruce Lee?

[00:25:32] I didn't use chopsticks, but I definitely caught a fly with my fingers.

[00:25:36] Whoa, dude. Super racially sensitive.

[00:25:40] Well, no, that's what he does in the movie, doesn't he?

[00:25:42] What movie?

[00:25:43] With the. He catches a fly with chopsticks.

[00:25:46] He does,

[00:25:47] I think. So. 

[00:25:47] I've only seen him play ping pong with nunchucks, wherever. 

[00:25:51] That is really cool. I don't think I could ever do that.

[00:25:53] I don't think that's real.

[00:25:55] It might be.

[00:25:56] Look at that. Caught a fly with my fingers.

[00:25:59] Oh, dude. First of all, it looks like a beetle.

[00:26:02] It's a fly. And I caught it. I got I once ate a fly that I caught, and I got a real bad sinus infection.

[00:26:10] I paid Davino a $100 once to drink a beer that a fly landed in.

[00:26:13] Did he?

[00:26:14] Yeah, he did. And he's still him. He's still. He's still there. I guess. 

[00:26:19] He's still alive. He's still alive.

[00:26:20] Oh. All right, I have other things. So you would own horses?

[00:26:23] Yeah. Just to like, chill with. I would chill with a horse. You know, horses can't see forward. Right.

[00:26:27] Because they're stupid.

[00:26:29] No, no, no, because their eyes are on their head.

[00:26:31] Oh, well, that makes sense. That's why they have blinders on. Well, that's why they always look like this. They, like, turn their head whenever they're looking at you.

[00:26:38] Yeah.

[00:26:40] Politicians.

[00:26:41] Like. Like lobbying.

[00:26:43] Yeah. Like, would you be like, one of those, like Oliver Stone? That's not him. That's the director of Roger Stone.

[00:26:47] Oliver Twist. I think you're thinking of.

[00:26:49] No, I'm definitely not Roger Stone. Oliver Twist was a little British boy. That just. 

[00:26:54] Is. Oliver Twist, the one who wanted more soup or more porridge. Oh, my God.

Joe: [00:26:58] Can I h

[00:26:58] ave some more?

[00:26:59] Can I have some more, please?

[00:27:00] He's like, no, we're all poor. 

[00:27:02] And then there's like, Miss Havisham is there? Or that might be different.

[00:27:05] Have a sham.

[00:27:05] Yeah, that's from Great Expectations. You remember that book?

[00:27:08] No.

[00:27:09] Get your book knowledge up, Jo Jo book Jo doesn't remember Great Expectations. Oh, because the guy fucking Phil Knight's on on the cover, right?

[00:27:19] What were you saying?

[00:27:20] Politician.

[00:27:21] Oh, yeah. No. Probably not. You. 

Frank: [00:27:23] Wouldn't be like one of those guys like, yo, I really care about this. Here's my money.

[00:27:25] No, I just I know I don't want to get mixed up in that weird world,

[00:27:29] Okay?

[00:27:30] I feel like people get killed and, like, people don't. And it's like, there's, like, real weird people do get killed.

[00:27:35] People do.

[00:27:36] I feel like there's a lot of blood transfusion with the. 

[00:27:38] There's like, you know, like blackmail and like, being, you know, like, getting in trouble for that.

[00:27:43] Yeah. And like, if you ever. 

[00:27:45] Manila envelopes all, all those blackmail people are the ones that buy all the manila envelopes. Oh, yeah.

[00:27:50] Follow the envelopes and you'll find that the, uh, the secrets.

[00:27:53] You ain't kidding. Yeah. So politicians. No, no, no.

[00:27:56] And then the last one I have here. Knives and throwing stars and swords and shit.

[00:28:01] Well yeah. You're going to start buying them.

[00:28:03] Well, I would probably. You know, I'm not even writing that off like regularly like without any sort of crazy amount of money getting some ninja stars. I've always been like very interested in. 

[00:28:13] When you throw them.

Joe: [00:28:15] Yeah. What am I going to do with them?

[00:28:16] I don't know, I mean, I don't know, that's what I'm asking.

[00:28:18] No, just fucking kidding. I would like throw them. You imagine being really good at throwing ninja stars. You could scare all your dinner guests like, you just, like, get really mad and, like,

[00:28:25] That would be cool. Do those things do damage? Like I've never heard of?

[00:28:29] What? It's a knife, bro.

[00:28:31] I mean, it's not a knife. It's like a fucking like. No, it's like a fidget spinner. Basically,

[00:28:34] It's with knife corners.

[00:28:37] With knives.

[00:28:38] Yeah. Dude is like, if I threw it at you, it would get stuck in your body.

[00:28:42] I don't think you could throw. What,

[00:28:44] Bro? If you.

[00:28:45] Have you seen any star Ninja star ever?

[00:28:48] I've seen movies. I've seen movies where it's made to make it look like it's worse. If you and I were sitting this close and I threw a ninja star at you. It's not going through your shirt.

[00:28:55] Yeah, dude.

[00:28:56] No, no,

[00:28:58] Not if you go like this. But if you threw it, like. 

[00:29:00] What about like, I would do, like, throwing knives. Those are cool because you could, like, have it right here and you could throw it like that.

[00:29:07] Yeah, of course that would be. 

[00:29:09] Stars are knives.

[00:29:10] I don't know. 

[00:29:11] They are.

[00:29:12] I mean I know. He's got the Google out again. What else you got. Yeah. Google how much a ninja star is. What else. Oh you want to look up more fossils. Ninja stars.

[00:29:24] Ninja stars for sale from Ninja shuriken at Karate Mart. Karate mart. Oh, dude, you could get this shit for cheap, man. Yeah, a seven point ninja star, $10.

[00:29:36] There you go.

[00:29:36] But like, I'm talking like you're going to get, like, some, like, ancient, like. Oh, this was the sword of fucking Rama. Rama-tut. 

[00:29:42] Rama-tut. 

[00:29:43] Mean, you know, Marvel. It's been in my head lately.

[00:29:45] Oh, yeah. It's a form of Kang. 

[00:29:47] King Tut.

[00:29:49] King tut was a real person, I believe, but, like, I don't think he had. 

[00:29:54] Heard Cleopatra was, like, fucking mad. Hot.

[00:29:57] Yeah. Also mad 12.

Joe: [00:29:59] What?

[00:29:59] Yeah, she was young.

[00:30:01] Oh, man, I didn't know that.

[00:30:02] Yeah. Jesus Christ, wait, what? Wasn't she, like, a very powerful pharaoh?

[00:30:06] Yeah, but she was, like, young. Like really young, I think. And, like, loved cats. Yo, Josh, let me take that out or something. Fact check. Fact check it. And. 

[00:30:17] Do you want me to fact check it right now?

[00:30:18] Isn't there a movie, Cleopatra, where there's, like, an adult?

[00:30:20] Yeah, with Liz Taylor. She was living the dream, all right? She was older.

[00:30:24] Okay. That's my only, like, interpretation.

[00:30:27] Okay. Fair enough. I think that interpretation. You're okay, but like, the real, like, version. Yeah. Super. Like 13.

[00:30:34] It's okay. We did a whole, uh, bracket of Disney princesses, and I'm pretty sure they were all like, fucking nine.

[00:30:39] And Ariel was like a child.

[00:30:41] Yeah, she's also a mermaid, so,

[00:30:43] Yeah. Not real.

[00:30:44] I don't know how, like the age of consent underwater.

[00:30:46] I think with, like, humans the same.

[00:30:49] Right.

[00:30:50] Like submarine, human and human the same, but like. 

[00:30:53] Submarine.

[00:30:53] Yeah. Like you're in a submarine. Human, human, underwater. But, like, I mean, I don't think animals can give consent because they're animals. Like, they can't communicate except for, like, birds. But then even then, they don't know what the fuck they're saying.

Joe: [00:31:06] You know what? That's actually a great question. Go ahead. Because you were saying with animals like the age of consent or whatever. Well, actually, no, this is a stupid question.

[00:31:16] Go ahead.

[00:31:16] No, I was just going to say, like, you were going to ask how do animals know? But it's like, obviously they're like in heat. And they could smell like we were going back and forth. They could smell like the person's like ready.

[00:31:26] They were like, smelling like they're like,

[00:31:28] They're ready for the taking.

[00:31:29] Ready to go. Yeah. You know, dogs wear diapers.

[00:31:33] Uh. What?

[00:31:34] Female dogs, when they get their period, they, like, legit. Like get their period. And when they're in heat, they wear diapers. Yes.

[00:31:42] Yeah. Why does anyone have a girl dog? I mean, I have a girl dog, but I'm pretty sure she was neutered before we got her.

Joe: [00:31:50] Oh, okay.

[00:31:51] I remember my cat when she used to go into heat. Bro,

[00:31:55] How often is this?

[00:31:56] I would say, like, once a month. Oh, so similar to, similar to, you know, the menstrual cycle for human women?

[00:32:02] Yes,

[00:32:02] Bro. When she was in heat, she was the horniest animal on the fucking planet. She'd be slamming pillows and stuff,

[00:32:10] Bro. I would go, I would call her name and she would fucking throw her ass up and back. I'd be like mystique. And like, she would, she would fucking. Yes. My cat's name is mystique, by the way.

[00:32:20] Yeah. It was,

[00:32:20] Uh, she was like super. She was ready to get fucking just wiped clean. Did she ever.

[00:32:30] That's an old cat too, right?

[00:32:31] She was mean. We had. She only lived to be, like ten. Oh, damn. Yeah, she was young.

[00:32:37] Don't cats supposed to be, like, 20 or something?

[00:32:38] Something like that. She had mouth cancer.

[00:32:41] Well, she's smoking cigarettes.

[00:32:42] She might have been. Fucked up. It is fucked up. But she's dead. All right, P. Sticky glue stick. What was what we would call it sticky. Sticky glue.

[00:32:54] I love that that sounds like something my mom would call, like.

[00:32:56] Yeah. What do you mean, Joey? Doo doo doo doo donuts.

[00:32:58] No, it's Keith cuda, dude. Cuda. Dude. Joey. Louie. Lou. Danny. Danny. Poo poo poo. Danny.

[00:33:05] And sunny Bunny. S

[00:33:06] unny Bunny was Thomas.

[00:33:07] Yes.

[00:33:08] I have nicknames for, uh, rogue.

Frank: [00:33:11] For your for my dog. And also my daughter. I have. She's not rogue. What do you call her? She's Ruby, so it's Ruby. Googly bear. Ruby, do Scooby doo. Uh huh. Zorba. Zorba's. Uh, what was that last one? Last one is a little tough. Zorba. Zorba's. Zorba. Zorba's literal zorba's. Zorba. Zorba's.

[00:33:30] Okay.

[00:33:31] It is, it is just blabber. There is nothing to it. There's no like, what is Zorba is, I don't know.

[00:33:38] Yeah,

[00:33:39] But in the moment, I just called her a Zorba.

[00:33:40] My sister calls her child. Mucho.

[00:33:42] Mucho.

[00:33:43] Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Kids. Moo. 

[00:33:46] Moo.

[00:33:47] Yeah. They moo. Who?

[00:33:50] Who does that? Kids.

[00:33:52] I don't know,

[00:33:53] Kids moo.

[00:33:54] They do that.

[00:33:55] Like, sometimes. 

[00:33:56] He sounded like a dinosaur in Jurassic Park.

[00:33:59] That would be cool. What. 

[00:34:01] If, like, they would be dinosaurs?

[00:34:03] If Jurassic Park was real, would you go one, two, three?

[00:34:05] Yes.

[00:34:06] Fucking absolutely not.

[00:34:08] Oh, really?

[00:34:09] I'm going to go hang out with dinosaurs.

Frank: [00:34:11] I mean, like, if it was real, like contained.

[00:34:14] Have you seen the movies?

[00:34:15] Well, their movies get bad at a certain point. Jurassic World, it was like that day it got bad, but like before then they were they made the implication that people were going all the time and they were sick of it. So they had to make a new dinosaur before then. I'd go. I'd go see fucking raptors and shit. How much enjoyment do you get out of going to the zoo? I've been to the zoo like twice,

[00:34:36] And. 

[00:34:38] I was a child and I liked seeing the peacocks.

Frank: [00:34:40] You went as an adult? We went together. You had to do a school project on it.

[00:34:44] What,

[00:34:45] You don't remember?

[00:34:46] No.

[00:34:46] When you were 18, for high school, you had to do a project. Me? And you went to the the Bronx Zoo.

[00:34:51] Whoa, dude.

[00:34:53] Yeah. Now you remember.

[00:34:54] Wait, wait, how old you say I wasn't 18,

[00:34:56] You were like 18. You were like 18. It was, bro.

[00:34:58] Was definitely in middle school.

[00:34:59] No, we. You think we were taking a trip to the Bronx by ourselves in middle school?

[00:35:04] Do you think I was doing an animal book report in a senior in high school? What, are you, fucking crazy?

[00:35:10] I vividly remember,

[00:35:13] Literally. I know for a factual thing. Not when I was 18,

[00:35:18] 17. 16.

[00:35:22] No,

[00:35:23] You were in high school. That's all I remember because we were older.

[00:35:26] Dude, I really think you're confusing. I think it was eighth grade.

[00:35:29] I can promise you, I'm not.

[00:35:31] I there's no way I was in high school,

[00:35:33] Bro, I'm telling you.

[00:35:34] Well, there was the report. Go tell me what a lion is.

[00:35:36] I don't know, but we went in the spring and it was before, like, all like the spring. And. 

[00:35:40] I went to the fucking. I went to a Catholic high school. There's nothing holy at the zoo.

Frank: [00:35:44] Don't say that.

[00:35:47] what. 

[00:35:47] That's not true. What's holy? Jesus was a shepherd. Wasn't he? He had sheep.

[00:35:53] No, no he wasn't.

[00:35:54] I think he was.

[00:35:55] We went over this.

[00:35:56] I think he was a shepherd.

[00:35:57] No, his dad was a carpenter. His mom was a virgin?

[00:36:00] Yes. And he was a shepherd.

[00:36:02] No, he wasn't a shepherd.

[00:36:03] Literally and figuratively. He was literally shepherd shepherding.

[00:36:07] No, I'm shepherd shepherding,

[00:36:08] Shipping.

[00:36:09] Shepherd. 

[00:36:10] Herding is the word I'm. 

[00:36:11] Herding. Boom.

[00:36:13] He was hurting the sheep. And then figuratively, he was a shepherd of the people. Go say it. Read it out loud, you son of a bitch! So I can be right.

[00:36:24] The good Shepherd is an image used in the periscope of John ten one 221. I don't know how to read those verses. Things in which Jesus Christ is depicted as the good Shepherd who lays down his life for his sheep.

[00:36:37] Thank you.

[00:36:39] There was a shepherd.

[00:36:40] Thank you.

[00:36:41] That's crazy.

[00:36:42] I told you this guy had fucking hell of sheep.

[00:36:46] A hell of sheep. I mean, he probably a few sheep.

Frank: [00:36:49] A couple sheep. Yeah. I love how they called us the people sheep. It's a very conservative way of thinking of us, you know? Are you like that?

[00:36:58] Actually, do. 

[00:36:58] You like that?

[00:36:59] Well, I don't think they're referring to it in a biblical way.

[00:37:01] I know they're definitely not.

[00:37:03] I think it's just like you sheep just follow each other.

Frank: [00:37:04] They just follow aimlessly.

[00:37:05] Why do they do that?

[00:37:07] And how do dogs do that, bro? Oh, dogs just like, know how to just get them.

[00:37:12] How to how to organize sheep.

[00:37:14] Yeah. They just like. 

[00:37:14] Also how do dudes stand on top of old abandoned movie theaters and know how to direct pigeons? How do they do that?

[00:37:21] Wait, what people?

[00:37:22] Dude, you've never seen that?

[00:37:24] An have I ever seen a man on top of an old movie theater directing pigeons?

[00:37:29] Yes,

[00:37:30] I can tell you I have not.

[00:37:32] I've seen it once.

[00:37:33] Oh, and so that's like.

[00:37:34] No, but people do it. People. People like, they they like. And the birds just start flying.

[00:37:39] I mean, I think if you make any noise near a bird, they're just gonna get. 

[00:37:42] No, Bro. They train t

[00:37:43] hem. I don't think they train,

[00:37:45] Bro. I'm telling you,

[00:37:46] Joey.

[00:37:47] Dude,I'm telling. 

[00:37:48] Who's training birds?

[00:37:49] It was also in an episode of Hey Arnold! Once.

[00:37:51] I remember that episode of Hey Arnold! But he had fucking breadcrumbs. He was, you know,

[00:37:55] Just going to train him somehow. You got to reward him, you dumb asshole.

[00:37:58] I don't think he was, like, able to say, like, fucking sit. And the birds would sit and shit like that.

[00:38:03] Sit. But it's definitely flying in circles. It's definitely that.

[00:38:06] Oh, you can tell a bird to fly.

[00:38:08] Yeah. Wow. You, you've.

[00:38:10] What else can they do? You can do push ups, bench press it.

Frank: [00:38:12] I don't know, but something if you're saying the word training, I'm expecting that there's some other level of fucking skill to what they're doing.

[00:38:19] Think about this.

[00:38:19] Go ahead.

[00:38:20] Pigeon letter carriers. That's a real thing. How the fuck can you do that?

[00:38:24] That is a mystery of history that has gone to time. I will never understand that.

[00:38:29] Take this to the British. How does he know where it's going? Where is the bird? Know?

[00:38:33] And how do you know when you get it? That like, it's like. Oh, this is from fucking. I mean, I guess if you read it. But like, if I'm like, yo, here, I'll take this to fucking Joe.

[00:38:43] And the owls are like, yeah, okay, cool.

[00:38:46] How will they know?

[00:38:46] And just goes,

[00:38:47] How will they know? That doesn't make sense.

[00:38:50] I'll send a raven. Like what, bro? What?

[00:38:52] I think those are windy, dude. Dude, I think those are. What if it's the winter? No fucking. What are you going to send? What are you going to send?

[00:38:59] They go south.

[00:38:59] They go. All of them.

[00:39:01] What if you're north?

Joe: [00:45:35] I just realized well, in my family group chat, my grandma died today. Not today like today, but years ago.

[00:45:44] Oh Jesus Christ, you see my face? I was like, Holy shit.

[00:45:48] No, my grandparents have been dead.

[00:45:50] Oh, they've been they've been gone.

[00:45:52] Yeah, they've been dead. Big. 

[00:45:53] Time. Dead. How long? How long?

[00:45:55] Nine years. Nine years.

[00:45:56] Which which one are we talking about? The one I liked.

[00:45:59] Which one did you dislike?

[00:46:00] I only liked, I only knew

[00:46:01]  one. That's the one.

[00:46:02] Oh. Oh, she was nice. She was great. Lady. We built a dresser for her. Do you remember that?

[00:46:07] Yes, and yes, I do remember why you're bringing this up. Yeah, I. So you guys know when you build like a little. By the way grandma R.I.P yes. Yeah. We did this in your apartment once.

[00:46:17] We did. She had no.

[00:46:18] No idea.

[00:46:19] No idea.

[00:46:19] She was just, like, cool. Hanging with Jesus.

[00:46:22] Yeah, well, yeah, she was mad religious.

[00:46:23] She loved God.

[00:46:24] Yeah. Big God guy.

[00:46:26] Her and God. 

[00:46:27] Boys. Anyway, we were putting together a dresser in her apartment, and you know how, like, you're making a drawer and the bottom of the drawer, you kind of just slip in,

[00:46:39] You slide it in,

[00:46:39] You slide in this like. 

[00:46:40] A backstop.

[00:46:41] Yeah, it's like a plywood type of thing, not plywood, but, you know, cork board or something. Yeah. So Frankie was like, yo, this is like a guillotine.

Frank: [00:46:52] Historical context. This was when we started making videos and we were super.

[00:46:57] No.

[00:46:57] Yes. And we were super into, like, the jackass. We would be like, yo. Like, when we first started doing videos, it was all like, jackass stuff. It was dropkick. It was this. Yeah. You know,

[00:47:08] It was stupid shit. 

[00:47:09] Whipping each other with a fucking belt.

[00:47:12] Belt,

[00:47:12] A baseball belt. Um, so this was in our head.

[00:47:18] Yeah. So Frankie decides, yo, this is like a guillotine. Because if you drop it, it's like. And it comes down like that. So Frankie goes, I'm gonna put my balls in it. I did, I had my ball, you know what? And then I filmed with your cell phone. 

[00:47:32] I did, you did. 

[00:47:33] His balls. And then Keith dropped this guillotine on Frankie's balls.

[00:47:38] And I remember as clear as day, both my balls were facing due north. And what happened was when it fell, it, like, hit the middle of them and it shoved them and made them go to the side like that.

[00:47:51] Like a division sign.

[00:47:52] Exactly like a division sign. Damn. It hurt.

[00:47:55] Yeah,

[00:47:55] Big time hurt. But we showed everyone that we knew. 

[00:47:58] In a way, super, uh, foreshadowing of today's day and age, because you feel like a lot of people are divided.

[00:48:04] My balls were representative of the American people. Yeah. Just gross. Fucking hairy. Not really. At the time, they were pretty. I mean, they were still gross. Not as hairy.

[00:48:14] Yeah.

[00:48:14] But. Yeah. So do you think your grandma smelled like balls stench in there? When we left? She was like, no, I smell a prepubescent boy.

[00:48:22] No, I don't think. No you didn't. I don't even think that she had that that sense, like I thought, I think she's like,

[00:48:28] Oh, she in her older age, she was just she couldn't smell.

[00:48:30] She I don't think she. Yeah. She never talked to me about smells ever.

[00:48:33] Well. 

[00:48:34] Like never like, oh that smells good. Like, I've never heard my grandma say. 

Frank: [00:48:37] Was your grandma? It's like a big thing in a lot of cultures that, like, the grandma was the ultimate cook. Do your grandma. Because your mom, by the way, is a fucking fantastic cook.

[00:48:46] Yeah, my mom's a good cook. I've never seen my grandma make a thing.

[00:48:48] Really?

[00:48:49] No, just just just. 

[00:48:51] She she would just kind of hang, hang out and, like, she smelled a lot because she wore, she would like cake on some fucking perfume. Shit.

[00:49:00] Oh. Like those old, like, the old timey ones that had, like, the little, like, pillow like, squeezy thing on the back.

[00:49:05] Yeah. It had like, the, the pump. It's like.

[00:49:07] Do you ever see a picture of her when she was younger?

[00:49:10] Probably, but I can't really picture it now.

[00:49:11] I was gonna say, could she, could she have caught it? Uh.

Frank: [00:49:15] My grandma. Well, not from you, I'm saying from. Well, she did catch it from someone.

[00:49:19] Well, she caught it from my grandpa.

[00:49:20] Yeah, yeah, but. 

[00:49:22] But I don't think people were catching stuff back then. It was like you kind of met someone in the first person you ever talked to for more than five minutes. You got married, like, ten minutes later.

[00:49:28] You got married ten minutes, had kids. Let them beat you your whole life.

[00:49:31] Yeah. Well, what?

[00:49:33] Oh, yeah. Beating women was, like, the cool thing to do. Oh, yeah. That that that. Yes, yes, yes.

[00:49:37] I always wonder if my grandfather's ever beat my grandmothers.

[00:49:40] Probably. Nah they did.

[00:49:43] You would think so. Right, I. 

[00:49:45] Yeah I'm certain.

[00:49:47] Oh. Well, do you know something I don't know,

[00:49:49] I just, I just feel like it.

[00:49:51] Yeah. My, my dad talks about his dad enough, like beating the shit out of him. That like it was only a matter of time before. Like. 

[00:49:58] Your dad ever hit you or. No. 

[00:50:00] Once.

[00:50:01] Fire. 

[00:50:02] Once. And then he said that he saw the fear in my eyes that I had of him. And he was like. Like no kid should fear their father.

[00:50:10] I wish he would have had a conversation with my dad. My dad ran on that.

[00:50:14] Yeah. Your dad ran train on. You. 

[00:50:16] Know, they say America runs on Dunkin. My dad ran on the fear and my fucking eyes. I'm telling you right now,

[00:50:22] America runs on Dunkin. Joe runs on fucking the fear of children.

[00:50:27] The tears of his young children. Yeah,

[00:50:29] No. And then my mom, they would just give me a look. And I knew, like, you know, I got a I got a chill.

[00:50:33] My mom was kind of wild too, man.

[00:50:35] There were times where my parents,

[00:50:37] My grandma, hit me once, too, I think.

[00:50:39] I don't think my grandparents ever hit me. I should have been hit a lot more.

[00:50:42] My grandma, like, hit my arm and I was like, get out of here, old bitch.

[00:50:45] Oh,

[00:50:45] I would never say, yo, yo, bro,

[00:50:48] If your mom heard you say this right now. Thank God.

[00:50:50] You know my mom. She knows I'm joking.

[00:50:52] She has a sense of humor.

[00:50:53] But my dude, my grandma, I'm actually, like, thinking about it because I've. I've seen my grandma like, mad before, and I'm like, yo, this bitch is crazy. Like, what's wrong with her? But if I ever said something like that, first of all, like literally, no lie, I've really do think that my parents would drive me out to the country and, like, beat me where there's no, like, no cameras or anything. Yeah. And then bring me like. And just, like, drive me home. It's like a 2.5 hour drive. And the whole time they're just telling me, like, if you tell on us, here's what's and you'll be, you'll just disappear. 

[00:51:26] Like, I feel like manipulating you. 

[00:51:28] If I call my grandma a bitch or something. Oh my God, dude, I got slapped for saying suck in my house.

[00:51:33] Oh, I got in trouble for saying scumbag in your house, if you remember that.

[00:51:38] Yeah, I do know.

[00:51:40] Yeah, I unfortunately, there was a point in my life where I was a really, really, really shitty person to my grandmother, and I've talked about this openly. It's a big regret that I have in my life. You saw a piece.

[00:51:52] It was a phase. It's called Your Teen Years.

[00:51:54] Yes. You saw it, but you saw a piece. It was tough because in my house, I mean, you saw. You saw what you, like were allowed to see, I guess, which was a lot, but not like in the grand scheme. Like, not all encompassing, you know, like it was tough because my mom's mom in her older age, you know, basically after her 75th birthday, was so senile and like, suffered really bad from dementia. And it was such a burden to us. And as a kid, I just, like, was mean to her.

[00:52:22] Yeah.

[00:52:22] And I was fucking, you know, I was mean. I remember when you I was really mean. And it's something I had to like. Yo, jokes aside, I have to live with the fact that I was such a fucking bad person. And I feel bad. But looking back, it's fucking kind of funny.

Frank: [00:52:39] Well, I remember that there was one time that you called her from a, like, a 69.

[00:52:45] This was really bad. This was real bad.

[00:52:47] And you pretended to be her friend from high school or something?

[00:52:49] Yep. Yeah,

Joe: [00:52:50] But, like, you just made up a name, I think.

[00:52:52] No. Yeah. So I called and I prank called my own grandmother in his own house from 50ft away. And she had bad dementia at this point. So I would I would say I was like, fucking like Evelyn from high school with her. And she'd be like, no. And my grandmother, as a kid, her nickname was go, go. Go go go go. Yeah. Oh my God. And so I would say you're going know what a go go dancer I know it's a slut.

[00:53:19] Whoa. It's not a slut. They just wear big boots.

[00:53:21] Oh, I thought it was just a whore. Oh, I thought my grandmother was a whore. 

[00:53:27] All this time you were under the impression. 

[00:53:28] I really did. Yeah. I mean, she was a beauty queen. She was Gloria from Astoria. She won like, a astoria's, like, hottest woman.

[00:53:36] Google that. Where is that?

[00:53:37] I'm telling you. I mean, I don't know if. 

[00:53:39] I believe it. I'm just saying I want to. I want to see this, like, old timey, like smoke. But, um, what's her name like? Oh, Gloria.

[00:53:47] Yeah. Yeah, well, I just said it.

Joe: [00:53:48] Yeah, I forgot, I'm sorry.

[00:53:49] Gloria from sorry. It's also a song.

[00:53:52] Wait, do you think that your grandma is going to pop up on fucking Google right now? I was kidding,

[00:53:56] No, I don't know. I'm kind of looking. Um,

[00:53:59] Would you know a picture of your grandma if you saw, like, an old ass one?

[00:54:01] Yes, yes, there are none, by the way, I can't see.

[00:54:06] Yeah, Frank, I fucking know.

[00:54:07] I googled, I googled Gloria from Astoria, and for some reason, a Biggie Smalls song popped up and n-words bleed. Don't ask me why. Um. But I feel really bad, like I hindsight. I remember one time in particular. My. My mom got us like, it was like a Nerf gun, but it was three Nerf guns that went into one.

[00:54:37] Damn. Like an Optimus Prime gun.

[00:54:38] Kind of.

[00:54:38] And one was like a hand gun. Like a pistol like Pew.

[00:54:41] Nice.

[00:54:41] You'd cock it back and shoot. The other one was like a machine gun and it all attached to a big rocket launcher. Oh, no. And we. Oh, by the way, I prank called my grandmother. She thought it was her friend from high school. It was really fucked up. I'm going to hell. Yeah. And we held her up, like, jokingly, like, put your hand. And she was like, no, stop. And I accidentally fired the rocket launcher and it hit her in the face.

[00:55:07] You've rocket launcher at your grandma,

[00:55:09] Bro.

Joe: [00:55:10] You're pretending to rob your grandma?

[00:55:12] I was jokingly trying to pretend to rob her. And you know how they say like. 

[00:55:16] She was, like, playing along at this point?

[00:55:17] No, she was like, don't know. You know, like, don't like,

[00:55:21] Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait. Did she think you were a robber?

[00:55:23] No, she didn't think I was a robber. She was like, you know, like parents from that generation. They always say like, yo never point something at someone because it'll shoot them and hit them in the eye.

[00:55:31] No. My question was, did you convince her that you were robbing her?

[00:55:36] No, no, no, we were.

[00:55:38] She was like, playing along then.

[00:55:39] No, no, she wasn't playing along. She was saying, like, if that goes off, it's going to hit me.

[00:55:43] Oh okay. Okay.

[00:55:43] And it did. And it hit her right in the side of the face. And I remember just this, like I vividly remember the sight of this giant fucking Nerf rocket launcher. Just fucking striking this woman in the cheek. It's so fucked. And it fucked up. No, no, no.

[00:56:01] If it makes you feel any better, uh, one time, my grandma sat down in a chair and she wasn't, like, a bigger woman or anything. But this chair we had cheap shit. She sat down on this chair, and it fucking shattered, dude. I almost passed out from laughing.

[00:56:16] Really?

[00:56:17] Yeah. Because when I'm. When you're that young, you don't understand. Like, yo, this is fucking dangerous when old people fall at this age. Yeah, well, she wasn't like, at that point. She wasn't that old.

[00:56:26] I mean, any yo falling after the age of 25 is scary.

[00:56:31] Yeah.

[00:56:31] Like,

[00:56:32] Well, she was like, probably, I don't know, like 60 something maybe. Still too scary to fall. Yeah. I mean, it's not old enough that it's like when, when an 80 something year old woman falls, you're like, oh, God, this is the beginning of the end here. Because like a surgery. And then God knows what happens like after that.

[00:56:46] And they, they get so many bruises.

[00:56:48] Yeah. They bruise like, yo, my dude, my mom, you know, got drunk. Uh oh. Maybe six years ago. Okay. I got drunk, hugged my mom, broke her rib. 

[00:56:59] Stop.

[00:57:00] Fractured her rib. Yeah.

[00:57:02] Are you kidding me?

[00:57:02] Swear to God. And I was wearing. And it was funny because I was drunk. It was the super Bowl, and we usually got a keg, and I just, like, was hammered, and I went upstairs, and I'm a hugger. I love my mom. Yeah, you love your mom. And I was wearing a onesie and it was a Superman onesie. And I hugged her and she screamed, uh. And I was like, oh my God, are you okay? And she goes, oh my, my rib. And then she like, whatever. And at the time I thought it was funny to be like, I am Superman.

Frank: [00:57:29] You are Superman. You fucking shattered your mom's rib. Yeah. So she was she was out of commission for like, four weeks or something,

[00:57:34] Bro. Old people just, like, get it the fuck together.

[00:57:37] Well, my mom also has crazy Irish skin. I mean, you flicker your mom.

[00:57:41] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, your mom bruises like a peach. Dude.

[00:57:44] My grandma too, bro. Forget about it. If it's windy that day,

[00:57:47] Your grandmother and your mom are basically translucent.

[00:57:49] Yeah, it's like, you know, no color to the skin.

[00:57:51] Literally. They're like fucking bananas. You open up a banana, you leave it on the the bruised and second brown in minutes. It's like an apple.

[00:57:58] Except your parents. I assume your mom does not do well in the sun.

[00:58:01] Fuck, no.

[00:58:02] Yeah, but yeah, my, my, I've always like, I know I joke about, like, this stuff with my grandmother, but I do really feel bad about it.

[00:58:10] I know you do.

[00:58:11] Because, like, you can't go back like, hey, I didn't understand. Like,

[00:58:15] Yeah, they get it, though. 

[00:58:16] I would hope that she like, if there is an afterlife and I see her, we're going to have a long talk.

[00:58:22] Yeah. She's going to hit you.

[00:58:23] She might. Yeah. But I don't think she was a very me like striking person. Well, she's had some time to stew over it, so yeah she's definitely she'll give you she's hearing this right now. She's like oh yeah. Really. Yeah.

[00:58:35] One time my grandma farted bro.

[00:58:37] Really? That's fucking disgusting.

[00:58:45] Your face just now.

[00:58:46] Oh, God. Oh fucking gross.

[00:58:48] Like I just said, she shit my face.

[00:58:49] Well, basically, because what I imagine of old people and I know I'm right here is like, they can't do anything, like, regularly anymore, so, like, a fart for them is just, just just fucking the river runs red of shit, you know, like it is. There's nothing they could do. Like they can't fart. They just basically just wet poop themselves all the time.

[00:59:09] No, bro. Nah, this is straight air, I could tell.

[00:59:12] What did it smell like? Just like a cobweb and a cave.

[00:59:15] I didn't smell it because as soon as I heard it, I just ran like hell. Yeah. It was like, I think I ran outside. I was laughing so hard.

[00:59:20] Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

[00:59:21] I just let her have it, though. But yeah, she was crazy, man. Like, she, like, fell one time. Hit her chin, her chin really hard. No, on the floor. And she was bleeding like crazy and like, the meat was hanging off of her chin. A bus driver, like, pulled over the bus and, like, walked her up to my house. I was like, yo, your grandma just fell or whatever. Like, what the fuck? And she was just like, good. She was my grandma. Yeah, I'm chilling. 

[00:59:43] Bro. It was at least a weekly occurrence. Maybe. Maybe not as frequent that in the middle of the night my grandmother would fall out of bed. Oh, and we would have the fucking fire department would come and they would have to pick her up, and they would either bring her to the hospital, or they would just put her back in bed. And it was.

[01:00:00] And why did you call the fire department? Well, you call 911 and the fire and rescue, they're the ones that come and they pick her up and then like. Like call an ambulance or they're just fucking be like, all right, she's good. She's in bed. But it happened a lot.

[01:00:12] Do you know, many times I faked that my grandma fell out of bed so I could leave work early.

[01:00:16] How many times?

[01:00:18] I think three.

[01:00:19] Oh, that's fucked up.

[01:00:20] Yeah.

[01:00:21] Oh, I worked at a pizzeria when I was like, oh, my grandma went down.

[01:00:26] They didn't give a fuck about, you know, when I would get. Remember, remember? I don't know if they still do this with kids, but like, when you would get a bad grade on a test, they would have your parents sign it, and then you would have to bring it back the next day.

[01:00:36] I used to forge everything,

[01:00:37] Bro. I used to give it to my grandmother and I would be like, oh, because my grandmother, by the way, people of that generation, their fucking handwriting was incredible.

Joe: [01:00:47] Yeah. What is that, bro? My mom's handwriting. Like it looks like a typewriter.

[01:00:51] My mom's just in bad, but my I remember vividly my grandmother's signature was fucking like. It was. A work of art.

[01:00:57] Yeah, it was amazing. And you can never replicate it. And I was like,

[01:01:00] I would be like, oh, yeah, yeah, I need you to sign this, this test. And she's like, oh, fucking 25. I was like, oh yeah, it's out of 25. And she's like, what's the slash 100 mean? And I was like, oh, I got 100 bonus points to like I would just fucking lie to her. She would sign it, I'd go in. But I use my grandparents to get I used to use my grandparents like to get out of shit all the time.

[01:01:21] Damn. That's actually a really smart.

[01:01:23] When I was in sixth grade. I think I've told this story here. I told I didn't do a month's worth of homework in one of my classes, and they asked me why, and I said, it's because my grandfather died. Yeah. And what did they say? She believed it. And then I'm pretty sure.

[01:01:38] Yeah. That's. You're fucking diabolical,

[01:01:40] I know. And then like, at, like, fucking parent teacher conference, the teacher was like, by the way, I'm so sorry to hear about the loss. And my mom was like, what? And she's like, oh, well, Frankie didn't do a month's worth of homework because he said his grandfather died and my mom was pissed.

Joe: [01:01:56] Knowing your mom,

[01:01:57] The teacher told me she was like, you disgust me. She said that to me.

[01:02:01] Your teacher said that to you?

[01:02:02] Yeah.

[01:02:02] Wait, which teacher was this?

[01:02:03] It was in sixth grade.

[01:02:04] Oh, I mean, I doubt anyone knows who this person is, Miss Ronan,But. 

[01:02:10] You disgust me.

[01:02:11] Yeah. And then. And my defense, I remember at the time, my defense was like he did die. It was just a long. It was like six years ago. So I remember trying to just like, fucking back it up, just being like, well, like it's just hitting me now. I was a fucking. 

[01:02:28] Double down on it.

[01:02:29] Double down. Dude,

[01:02:30] You do disgust me. I'm on her side, you freak.

[01:02:34] I was it was bad. It was fucked up.

[01:02:36] I hated parent teacher bro.

[01:02:38] Oh my God, dude, my mom, my your mom got involved in in school after we left.

[01:02:44] Your mom was the PTA.

Frank: [01:02:46] My mom was everything. Oh, my president, treasurer, vice president. Bro. She would like, go out to, like, fucking party with the teachers. Yeah. And any time at any parent teacher conference, my mom went, I like there was actually no point for my mom to go because she knew everything already, like anything happened. My mom would fucking bark at me. And she was so cool with these people that like anything I did, I was in fucking trouble for. Yeah, my dad didn't give a fuck.

[01:03:12] Yeah, my dad never showed up to anything.

[01:03:13] My dad,

[01:03:14] Well, that's. I meant like, any parent teacher conference. He was just like, you know, my my dad, my dad one time, actually, I think I've told you this also, I don't know, but, like, when I was going to Louis Armstrong, he had a, he had to have a meeting with the principal because I like got into a fight and then the assistant principal told me that they might send me to a like kick me out of the school and send me to my own school, which was actually Beechwood School. You kind of would have been cool, but I was like super upset. And my dad double parked, gets inside. The school's like, yeah, I'm here to see Miss David. And they're like, yeah, ten minutes. He got in his car and left. The meeting never happened. And then like nothing, no one ever said anything to me and I stayed.

[01:03:53] I think I've told this story too. But when I was in middle school, I sat and we had like a class where we had to, like, comment on other people, like we were like building a website and we had to comment on other people's like, designs and shit like that. And I was at a table with kids, and we all had our own laptop, and we would sign in and someone commented on one of the girls pages, you smell not not like anything more elaborate. Yeah. Which I'll get back to you in a sec. You smell. And the whole. I was out at the bathroom when this happened. I signed out because when you would have to sign out to go and use the bathroom and sign back in, I had signed out. And when I came back, the girl ran out crying. And the principal was like, yo, I know you did this. Let's go. And I was like, yo, I signed up for the bathroom. I wasn't here and like the timestamp and everything was on it. Flawless defense, but everyone from the fucking table was brought down to the principal because they were like, yo, like you're all, someone's going to get in trouble. So they made my dad come for a meeting and I knew, like, yo, if my mom came, I knew I was not like I was in trouble. Like period. My mom came. She'd be like, yo, not only did he do this, he also tried to kill someone. Yeah, like my mom would just throw in shit.

[01:04:57] My son needs to be put in prison.

[01:04:58] Yeah, basically, my mom used to threaten me with putting me in Greek school. Little did I know that my mom couldn't afford Greek school.

Joe: [01:05:07] I will say you took it to school with Dimitri Stavro.

[01:05:09] Yeah, it was. Yo. If you fuck up again, I will put you in Saint Demetrius. That's what it was.

[01:05:13] That's fire.

[01:05:14] And my dad, they said like, yo, your dad needs to show up tomorrow morning, 8 a.m., for a suspension hearing with all the kids and their parents, too. And my dad was working nights at that time, so I was like, fuck. So I called him. My dad was like, nope, I'll be there. I'm like, okay, fucking eight, eight, oh five, eight, ten, eight, 15 rolls around, my dad's not there. So I'm like, fuck. Like they're not going to like, either way, I'm going to get in trouble because everyone hated me at that school. Everyone. And my dad shows up fucking blasting Colombian music at 840 in the morning, full Puma track suit with a giant like you. Remember when Dunkin Donuts and Baskin Robbins would make, like, those coffee drinks, but they'd put a scoop of ice cream on them?

[01:05:56] No.

[01:05:57] Yeah, my dad used to get them all the time, like colada or some shit. Yo, bro, you showed up and he was like, all right, let's go in and we go in, and my dad's just sitting there like. And these fucking parents, like, are like, my son would not do it. There was one like, middle European woman who was like, my son was bullied. How could you do this? Like, this is so like you're. Like talking to me. And I'm like, oh, fuck. Like I'm in trouble.

[01:06:19] Yeah, dude.

[01:06:22] Bro, they unloaded on me at a point. My dad just goes, my dad stops the meeting and goes. Like, let me let me ask something. What? Happens because guess what? He's not going to snitch on him. He's not gonna snitch on him. We ain't gonna find out who did it. So what happens? And the principal was like, oh, you know, like, we're just going to. My dad goes. What is gonna happen? And they're like, uh, they won't be able to use the computers for a month. My dad goes. Oh, he looks at me. He goes, do you give a fuck about using the computers?

Joe: [01:06:57] Oh my God. 

[01:06:58] And I go.No. And he stands up. All right, I'm done here. He looks at me. He goes, I'll pick you up. Ice cream later. Gives me a Big hug and kiss and then just fucking walks out.

[01:07:02] I'll pick you up from ice cream later. That sounds exactly like your dad.

[01:07:15] My dad loves ice cream. Yeah, his arteries probably don't like,

[01:07:18] Don't like him.

[01:07:19] No, but. And then, like, that's what, like, at least your dad would just leave. My dad would come in and just fuck with everyone and then leave.

[01:07:26] You know, my dad was. My parents were like. Your mom was just kind of like, if they have to come to the school, I'm already getting in trouble.

[01:07:33] Yeah, yeah.

[01:07:34] Even if they came and, like, found out, like I did nothing, it'd be like. Yeah, but I had to come here. So you're in trouble.

[01:07:39] To their defense, they were kind of honest. Something we were we were kind of pieces of shit.

[01:07:47] None. Not in elementary school. We were good.

[01:07:50] Well, kind of. I mean, we didn't know how to be assholes yet. We were, but we didn't know what we were doing. Like when we were chanting,

[01:07:59] No, no no no no no no no no no. None of that. That story is in the vault there. That one stays in there. That.

[01:08:18] This is this is the perfect example. Like this is this is encapsulation of our friendship. Yeah. Right. There is I'm just like ready to tell it. And you're like,

[01:08:27] You know what it was. It was 2001.

[01:08:30] It was a it was a rough time.

[01:08:32] It was, it was. Oh, that might have been 2000. That might have been 1999.

[01:08:36] No no no, no I believe yeah. Actually, you know what you might think it was. No, it was 2001, 2001 or 2002, 2000, 2002, 2002. No. It was yes, it was third grade. Yes. No. Oh. Fourth grade. Yes. 2001, 2002 2002 I'm telling you 19 years ago. Yeah, that's crazy. If we told that story.

[01:08:57] Big ups, big,

[01:08:59] Big, big whoops,

[01:09:00] Big whoops.

[01:09:01] Nothing too crazy. I mean, let's not hype it up like, yeah,

[01:09:04] I mean, we just we said things that were just not cool. Yeah. And they were fucked up. And probably. 

[01:09:09] It wasn't like it wasn't like fucking racist shit or anything.

[01:09:11] Yeah. No, no. 

[01:09:12] Jesus Christ like chill out.

[01:09:14] Like probably caused someone to drink but put it like that. Yeah.

[01:09:20] Good times man.

[01:09:21] Nah. What were those good times?

[01:09:23] I mean, yeah, the world was so carefree, I think. Yeah. I don't even know what I'm saying.

[01:09:28] Any of your grandparents still alive?

[01:09:29] No. They're all they're all. All of them gone taking a dirt nap, as they say. Yeah, that's what they say.

[01:09:34] Is that what they say. 

[01:09:35] They do?

[01:09:36] Oh, I just had super deja vu. I think we've had that exact conversation before. What, like the dirt nap? Is that what they say?

[01:09:43] Oh, I don't know.

[01:09:44] Oh, boy.

[01:09:46] I got that from a what's angry two angry old man. What's that movie?

[01:09:49] I don't know,

[01:09:50] Angry old men something what. 

[01:09:52] I literally am having ultimate the ultimate version of deja vu right now.

[01:09:56] Elephants. Is it gone?

[01:10:00] No, I mean, not really. Okay, say another random word.

Joe: [01:10:06] Gertsch.

Frank: [01:10:09] Why can't you do that?

[01:10:10] I don't know, I can't think of anything.

[01:10:12] Why can't you do that?

[01:10:12] You know, when someone puts you on the spot and you're just like, name a woman. 

[01:10:15] I know.

[01:10:15] Name a woman,

[01:10:16] Stephanie.

[01:10:16] Know name any woman, a woman everyone would know.

[01:10:19] Oh, Liz Taylor,

[01:10:22] I know you are like this. Like, for instance, word association chapel. No.

[01:10:30] Huh? Give me one.

[01:10:31] All right. Just just off the top. Ready? Three. Two. One word association. Eraser.

[01:10:36] Bo. I said Bo.Actually, honestly, when you first said eraser, I thought of the Scholastic Book Fair eraser.

[01:10:43] Okay. All right. Those are cool.

[01:10:44] What was the thing we went to? It was like the star Dome.

[01:10:46] Yeah, the astrology lab. Uh, science lab,Star lab.

[01:10:50] Star lab,

[01:10:51] Star lab.
