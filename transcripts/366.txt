Joe: [00:00:00] Welcome back to the base. Welcome back to the basement yard.

Frank: [00:00:08] Oh, go!

[00:00:10] Okay. So today.

[00:00:20] I forgot to swallow. 

[00:00:21] Jesus,

[00:00:23] As I do. 

[00:00:23] Today, we're. Oh, okay. Oh, that was a joke.

[00:00:28] Today we're both wearing Yankee hats.

[00:00:30] We are. We're going to the Yankee game.

[00:00:31] We are going to the Yankee game. Hopefully by the time this comes out, it probably already happened.

[00:00:35] Shout out to my man. 

[00:00:36] Aaron Judge AJ. 

Joe: [00:00:37] Well no I was going to say shout out to. 

[00:00:38] Oh our super boy. I thought well because I was going for the record I was I was referencing the record but well can we say him? Will he get in trouble if they find out he listens to this?

[00:00:48] No,

Frank: [00:00:49] It's our fucking boy Jose Trevino. What's up? We're name dropping now.

[00:00:53] Yeah. Big time.

[00:00:54] Tell everyone about your famous friends. So we decided we're going to have a couple beers.

[00:01:00] We're going to have a couple of beers because we have the games in four hours.

[00:01:04] yeah, Honestly, too late to start drinking. So we have some catching up to do. What you can honestly could you. Well that's a, that's a hazy IPA. It's a little hazy. 

Joe: [00:01:18] 9%. That'll be at the end of this.My butt's going to be open.

Frank: [00:01:22] I got to tell you, I drank that as I ate for the first time today, so I'm feeling a little floaty, you know what I mean? Like a little, like right here.

[00:01:30] Are you horny?

[00:01:31] I'm not horny at the moment.

[00:01:32] Do you get horny when you get drunk?

[00:01:35] Um, I don't think I'm more or less horny when I'm drunk.

[00:01:38] I think I just have, like, a baseline of horny.

Frank: [00:01:40] I think I have a pretty good baseline of horn.

[00:01:42] Dude, what the hell? I'm not saying I'm sure you have a healthy, horny baseline, but I'm saying, like, it doesn't like either increase or decrease.

[00:01:48] You know what I think increases? I think not anymore because I fucking I'm married, but like during college, it's not that I was horny when I drank. I was lonely, so I wanted to, like,

[00:01:59] Don't say real stuff.

Frank: [00:02:00] I know it can't be real. Right? Hold on. Let me. But where are the tits?

[00:02:09] That was. That was disgusting.

[00:02:10] That was almost worse.

[00:02:12] Yeah,

[00:02:12] It was almost worse.

[00:02:13] What'd you say? Where's the tits?

[00:02:14] Yeah, I had a drink to become more of a hyper man.

[00:02:17] Hyper man?

[00:02:18] Hyper. Hyper masculine is a word, man.

[00:02:20] Yeah.

Frank: [00:02:21] I'm gonna reek like beer.

[00:02:23] Dude, that was a given. We're all going to smell like beer.

[00:02:26] Um, no, I think it's just like. I remember back in my college days, I just wanted to hang out with people. Like, I never wanted the party to stop. I wanted to, like, keep going.Yeah, which is sadder than being horny.

Joe: [00:02:36] Ask me.

[00:02:37] You get horny when you're drunk.

[00:02:39] Yeah.

[00:02:41] You get, like, real horny.

[00:02:52] The way you just said that.

[00:02:54] Yeah.

[00:02:54] You get real.

[00:02:55] You get real horny.

[00:02:56] Yeah, yeah.

[00:02:57] You.

[00:02:57] Well, tell me. 

Joe: [00:02:58] What you want me to be. Fucking rocket. Rocket ship right now.

[00:03:01] Well, are you going to get horny? That is going to be me.

[00:03:03] No no no no.

[00:03:04] Surrounded by 58,000 Yankee fans.

Joe: [00:03:07] Here's the thing. I think that, like when you when you're drunk, you're like, yeah, but then also I'm like, probably not, though. I just think because once I hit an Uber, I'm asleep and then I don't remember anything.

Frank: [00:03:16] Yeah, you do fall asleep pretty easy and you also disappear pretty easily. You're the big spoke about it before. Yeah.

[00:03:23] Irish.

[00:03:23] You're the king of Irish. Goodbyes.

[00:03:24] Yeah.

[00:03:25] And you're Irish.

[00:03:26] I like to dip the fuck out.

[00:03:28] I just think that. 

Joe: [00:03:29] I had people at my apartment the other day.

[00:03:31] And you just went to sleep,

[00:03:32] Bro.I'm.I'm sleeping on the couch and someone goes, yo, are you sleeping? I'm like, nah, I'm like this, right? Then all of a sudden I'm like. Dude, I just got up and went into my bed and shut the door. Yeah, and I woke up and people were gone.

Frank: [00:03:47] Yeah, that's not like you should say bye.

[00:03:50] Oh, no one said no, no, no one got the bye.

Frank: [00:03:53] I'm the other end of the spectrum, though. Like we went to Josh's wedding recently. It took like an extra 20 minutes for me to leave because I had to say goodbye to every person I said hello to. So like as I was walking out, I was like, all right, ladies man, good seeing you. Good. See you. Let's catch up. Bop bop bop bop.

Joe: [00:04:08] Weddings. Definitely not. You saying bye to the bride and groom. I'm fucking out! Grude!

Frank: [00:04:13] Yeah, Who's that?

Joe: [00:04:14] I don't know.

[00:04:15] I mean, I had to say bye to the bride and groom.

[00:04:17] Yeah, of course,

[00:04:18] But like.

[00:04:19] Which I didn't do, by the way.

Frank: [00:04:27] No I said bye to the bride and groom said bye to the people that I said hi to. And then I was fucking out.

[00:04:31] I was on the same bus as them, bro. We're on the same bus. Oh, I didn't have to say bye.

[00:04:35] Well, yeah, technically, you didn't have to say bye. You were going to the same centralized location, right? But yeah, you're a big you love that shit. You love just being, like, out. There are nights that I remember having the most fun of my entire life. And you being there. And there are other points of that night where you're just not.

Joe: [00:04:49] That's what I do, baby. Sometimes I got to go outside and pee in an alleyway. The last time I did that.

Frank: [00:04:54] Hold on. You leave a bar with a bathroom to go pee in an alleyway?

[00:04:58] Yeah, I've done, like, mad times. Yeah, because. Because.

Frank: [00:05:00] Because you want to get caught.

[00:05:01] No.

[00:05:02] You like the thrill because you're horny and you want to go. Do you know diddle daddle people's fucking.

[00:05:07] I'm not slapping it in an alleyway. I'm going to piss. I'm going to urinate. So. But the reason why I did that is because the last time I did it, we were at a bar. But the line was so long and I was like, oh God, my bladder is yelling,

[00:05:19] Okay, let's talk.

Joe: [00:05:20] My bladder is having an argument. So I had I had to leave.

[00:05:22] Why?

Frank: [00:05:23] There should never, ever, ever be a line in a men's bathroom. Ever. You know how long it takes.

Joe: [00:05:28] It's too unisex. It's the women.

[00:05:31] Oh, duh.

[00:05:32] As usual, it's huge. It's the fucking women,

[00:05:35] I swear to God.

Joe: [00:05:37] You know, being a woman, I can't do it because I drink too much beer and I got to pee.And women. Yeah, bro, you guys are in there.

[00:05:43] You're fucking down. You basically have to, like, fucking, like, get naked and give your body to Christ in order to pee.

[00:05:49] Dude, women who wear rompers, it's like you haven't thought this through, bro.

Frank: [00:05:53] That scares me. I don't understand,

[00:05:55] Like bodysuits. You got to, like, unclip your puss and then, like, open up the whole suit to take a shit or piss.

[00:06:02] Listen.

[00:06:02] It's crazy.

Frank: [00:06:03] All I'm saying is we need to be in many ways more accommodating of women in their pee situation. So, like, give them more like, give them. They should have special women pants that have a zipper underneath. Not like on the top, a zipper underneath.

Joe: [00:06:17] Frankie, women aren't going to have a zipper down here. Open it up and then stretch it open and piss through that.

[00:06:24] Why not?

[00:06:24] Wouldn't you?

[00:06:25] I've done it.

[00:06:26] You piss like an idiot.

[00:06:27] I don't piss like an idiot, Joey, you don't piss in a logical fucking manner.

[00:06:31] I pull my pants down and I pee like a person big. You shove it.

Frank: [00:06:34] Big pants, zipper hole, big pants, big pants. Gave you the opportunity. Big fucking pee with your pants on and you're deciding not to take it. I'm clearly just trying to utilize the fucking tools that have been handed to me. You, on the other hand, you want to ignore logic. You want to fucking pee like a psychopath by pulling your pants all the way down to your ankles like some fucking idiot in middle school?

Joe: [00:06:55] First of all, no one pulls their pants down to their ankles, you idiot. I literally just go like this. I just I just flop it out, I go, bruh, and then I pee, and then I flop it back in.

[00:07:05] Joey was the kid in elementary school that had the elastic bottoms of his gray sweatpants that would pull his fucking pants all the way down to his ankles, bare ass pee in a urinal that was at his feet, legitimately.

[00:07:14] Never done that.

[00:07:15] That was you 100%.

[00:07:16] It wasn't.

[00:07:16] I utilized the fact that the pants come with a fucking a piss alley.

[00:07:20] What about what about sweatpants? What then, hotshot?

[00:07:22] I pull them under my balls.

[00:07:25] What?

[00:07:26] I pull him under my balls.

[00:07:27] You pull. What? Under your balls.

[00:07:29] The whole pant.

[00:07:31] Hold on. Are you joking?

[00:07:34] What is there to joke about?

[00:07:36] You wear sweatpants.

[00:07:37] Yes.

[00:07:38] Right?

[00:07:38] Yes.

Joe: [00:07:38] And you have to pee.

[00:07:39] Yeah.

[00:07:39] And when you pee with sweatpants on, you pull the whole pant, and you. You pull your balls out like you put the elastic band under your balls.

[00:07:47] Yes.

[00:07:49] For why? Why?

Frank: [00:07:50] Well, you know, the boys like to get, you know, even fucking prisoners have a couple minutes of rec time in the outside, you know, give the boys some time to play.

[00:07:59] I don't even know what to say to you.

[00:08:01] You don't have to say anything outside of the fact that I have six beers on my table. And you have three, and that says more about my personality than you.

[00:08:07] We'll find out who has more beers at the end of the fucking episode, bitch.

[00:08:11] You just want to be very clear. Is this a competition?

[00:08:14] I don't want to say that.

[00:08:16] Because if it is, you have a big thing coming your way.

Joe: [00:08:18] Well, no, I'm going to start shotgunning beers. Then.

[00:08:21] What we want to are we are, we are.

[00:08:24] We feel like we shouldn't because it's going to get everywhere.

[00:08:27] Oh, no.

[00:08:29] Um. There's rugs.

Frank: [00:08:30] Yeah. There's rugs. I mean, I can control it. This is off the rails already?

[00:08:35] Yeah.

[00:08:36] We aren't even a full beard.

[00:08:37] Control it.

Frank: [00:08:38] I can control the amount of liquid on the floor.

Joe: [00:08:40] You can't even piss correctly. You have no control.

[00:08:42] I got to say, I got to be honest, I don't really like your slander, my techniques of pissing. I piss in an efficient, clean and fucking, like, smart manner where you're out here and you're just like, let me whip out my fucking cock. And I'm just like, bro, I'm in there for business. The bathroom isn't a time for fucking, you know,

Joe: [00:09:00] You spend more time taking out your balls. I take out less things than you. You understand that, right?

[00:09:04] No. Do you know how long it takes to take out balls?

[00:09:07] Longer than it takes to not take them out?

[00:09:09] No.

[00:09:10] You grab them with the dick. There's no difference.

[00:09:12] No, I frankly, there's no difference.

[00:09:14] Does it take. Let me ask you something. Does it take you longer to eat a piece of pizza with pepperoni or cheese? There's no difference because it's all in the same bite. Baby, I'm grabbing my dick and balls in one fucking swoop of the nest.

[00:09:25] Horrible, horrible fucking metaphor.

[00:09:27] No it's not.

[00:09:28] That was horrible. That makes no sense.

Frank: [00:09:29] No, you want to fucking. You want to. You want to fucking pass through your dick and balls in order to pull only your dick out. And it's quite the laborious task, I have to admit.

[00:09:39] It's not that fucking fucking say that word one more time. This is three episodes in a row with this shit, with laborious. But listen, I don't know what your dick and balls looks like. I've seen it at years ago.

Frank: [00:09:49] I'll tell you, this hasn't changed much.

[00:09:51] Well, I'm just going to say maybe. I don't know that if a car smashed into there and mixed it all up, because what you're talking about right now is, like, you got to sift through to find your dick and balls. What's happening down there?

[00:10:05] Nothing.

[00:10:06] Because that's not what happens for the rest of us.

Frank: [00:10:08] Listen, you need to you need to specify if you want to pull your dick and or. 

[00:10:13] You ever pee with a boner.

Frank: [00:10:14] Oh, yeah. It's violent. Peeing with a boner is basically like recreating a crime scene.

[00:10:22] What's up?

[00:10:23] Peeing with a bonus like recreating a crime scene?

[00:10:25] Yeah, I what the fuck does that mean?

[00:10:27] It's a very violent.

[00:10:29] And why are you saying it's violent?

[00:10:31] Because, bro, you pull your dick out and it fucking angle, angle, angle angle angles out that too.

[00:10:36] Yeah.

[00:10:36] You know, and then you have to like, aim it and then the pee comes out like there's no control.

[00:10:41] What do you do. You go hands on wall.

[00:10:43] No I go I go both hands on deck.

[00:10:46] And you just point down. 

[00:10:48] I point it down. Yeah.

[00:10:49] Oh, but sometimes I, I'm too boned. I can't point all the way down. And it hurts. It hurts. I mean, you could, but like, it hurts.

[00:10:55] Your dick comes hinged against your body.

[00:10:57] Joey, how are you not able to point your dick down?

Joe: [00:11:01] But I'm also fighting my boner. Sometimes the boner is too strong.

[00:11:04] Does your boner have roots in your fucking ass? Why does it go all the way back to your body where you can't point it down?

[00:11:09] It's definitely.Yeah.I mean, honestly, probably.

[00:11:12] I don't know the anatomy behind it, but probably rooted in my the rest of my shit.

[00:11:15] Get a boner right now. Let me see if I.

[00:11:18] If I try to push my boner all the way down flat. That's not happening. Like, I'll get I'll be.

[00:11:23] Well, first of all, flat. My dick doesn't look like it could fit in a fucking, you know? You know what I mean?

[00:11:28] I mean, like, point it down. Point the hole down.

[00:11:30] Well, sometimes I have to angle myself.

Joe: [00:11:32] Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Sometimes your hand on the wall.

[00:11:34] No, I can I can stand up and keep a good center of gravity.

[00:11:37] Just Michael Jackson it. 

Frank: [00:11:38] I do, I do a bit of Michael Jackson.

[00:11:39] Just lean it.

[00:11:42] I've also I've also on like really desperate occasions. Like really drunk occasions. Sat down like straddled the toilet bowl to pee like that. 

[00:11:49] With a boner.

[00:11:50] Yeah. Dude, you have to.

[00:11:51] Oh, wait. Sat on straddled it.

[00:11:53] Yeah.

Joe: [00:11:54] What do you mean?

[00:11:54] Just like you're facing the toilet.

[00:11:56] Take a sip. Piss.

[00:11:57] Oh.

[00:11:59] You straight?

[00:12:00] What?

[00:12:01] Yeah.

[00:12:01] Hold on.

Joe: [00:12:02] You mean wait, is this the the thing. 

[00:12:06] You're looking at, the bowl. 

[00:12:07] You're looking at? No, this is the tank.

[00:12:08] The bowls in front of you.

Joe: [00:12:09] You hug the tank?

[00:12:10] Yeah.

[00:12:11] You piss reverse.

[00:12:13] I've done it before.

[00:12:15] You've never done it,

[00:12:16] Have I pissed Reverse? No.

Frank: [00:12:17] Why? Because it's a it's a sharp. That's a sharp, dangerous situation.

Joe: [00:12:24] But you pissed. Reverse.

[00:12:27] Yes.

[00:12:27] Was the last time we done that.

[00:12:29] Years ago.

[00:12:30] How many?

[00:12:32] Seven. Eight.

[00:12:33] Oh, so you're not reversing all the time?

Frank: [00:12:35] No, no, it was college.

[00:12:37] That was a fun. It was an experimental time.

[00:12:39] It was a great time.

Joe: [00:12:41] I can't believe that you did that.

[00:12:42] You've never. You know, this is something that you do, Joey.

[00:12:45] I want to do it, though. I do want to do it. I definitely want to piss reverse. 

[00:12:50] Just because someone that you haven't done something, you look upon it as like, this is crazy,

[00:12:55] Wrong, wrong.

[00:12:56] It's crazy.

[00:12:57] No, the issue that I have with you is that you do things in a wild manner and won't even acknowledge the fact that it's unorthodox. And I go, hey, man, first of all, take my penis out and pee, and you go, what? You don't take your balls out and fucking flick of the lights on?

Frank: [00:13:11] No, Joey. No, no. I like to get creative with the way that I'm a very efficient person. I often also probably every time, every time I pee, I flush a toilet in between, like as my stream is dying down so I don't have to as my stream dies, then flush it. I try to be as efficient as possible.

[00:13:29] I do that sometimes.

[00:13:29] You do that, you race it.

[00:13:31] Yeah, but I've messed up.

Frank: [00:13:32] Yeah. Me too. I messed up all the time.

[00:13:33] I hate that.

[00:13:34] No. Life is. You're not perfect.

Joe: [00:13:36] Um. You hold on, hold on. Speaking of. Nobody's perfect.

[00:13:39] Oh, the the thing I sent you the other day. 

[00:13:42] With Kirk Cousins.

Joe: [00:13:42] Yeah, it was an old Kirk Cousins. He's a quarterback in the NFL. Super religious guess. 

[00:13:49] Is he.

[00:13:50] Yeah I'm pretty sure.

[00:13:51] Oh was he. Is he like Christian Catholic. 

[00:13:54] Probs. 

[00:13:55] Jewish.

Joe: [00:13:57] No no man he's one of them. But enough to hate gays. I know that he's that religious because. 

[00:14:03] You don't have to look hard to find a religion that hates the gays.

Joe: [00:14:06] A reporter asked him, like, how would you feel about like a gay teammate? And he's like, no one's perfect.

[00:14:13] Listen. It's wrong. Yeah, but hysterical.

Joe: [00:14:16] Yeah, because that's a hilarious response. Nobody's perfect because I think he thought he was being nice.

[00:14:24] I thought he was being like. Yeah, like he thought, like all of us have things, you know? But he's basically saying that that is the wrong. That's not making them perfect. You know,

Joe: [00:14:33] Like he's saying like like he could have been a great guy, but unfortunately he's fucking gay.

[00:14:36] He loves sucking dick. You know,

[00:14:38] You think you think all of them like I don't think.

[00:14:40] No no no no absolutely not. Not all men like not all heterosexual men like, you know, reading the books of, you know, pages of a book, if you catch my drift.

[00:14:50] What does that mean? Eating vagina. 

Frank: [00:14:52] Cunnilingus? Yeah.

[00:14:54] Yeah, but it doesn't mean they don't like vagina.

[00:14:57] No, it doesn't mean they don't know.

[00:14:58] We're talking about straight oral stuff.

[00:15:00] Yeah.

[00:15:00] Oral.

[00:15:00] Yeah.

Frank: [00:15:01] Oral is a texture thing you can imagine, you know.

[00:15:04] Yeah. Sucking penis is probably super hard. It's probably, like, tiring.

[00:15:09] All right, we got drinks in us.

[00:15:10] I'm just saying, isn't it? Doesn't it. Doesn't it feel like. 

[00:15:13] You talk? Shut up.

Joe: [00:15:14] It feels like a lot of work.

[00:15:15] I'm just going to say that.

[00:15:16] Got to be honest with you. It seems like.

[00:15:19] It seems like too much.

[00:15:20] It seems like it would just be, like, a pretty tiring, tiring. It's a lot going on,

[00:15:27] I know, because. And the whole body's. 

Frank: [00:15:29] Because, like, the thing with, you know, pleasuring orally, pleasuring someone with a vagina,

[00:15:35] Sucking cock. Oh, pussy.

[00:15:36] Well, what? And it's like it's all in the outside.You can keep your mouth closed.And you can just do that.

Joe: [00:15:44] You do what?

[00:15:45] I'm not saying I do that. I'm saying, like,

[00:15:46] I don't know what you did. You can. You do.

Frank: [00:15:47] I'm saying, like, it's all in the outside.

[00:15:48] You know what I mean?

[00:15:49] Yeah.

[00:15:49] With a penis, it becomes part of your body at that point in time. So, like, you need to welcome you need to welcome this thing into your mouth. And then you need to, like, really put on a show for it.

[00:15:59] You definitely have to roll out the red carpet for sure.

Frank: [00:16:01] You catch my drift? Like you need to welcome them into your home and then you need to fucking like, you know, be our guest for a week and a half.

[00:16:06] Yeah, you ain't got to entertain them.

[00:16:08] That's a lot, man. Being being a being a host is not easy.

[00:16:11] I just feel like we don't have to move too much. I mean, I guess it's an even trade. Actually, gay dudes have it the worst.

[00:16:20] BRO. Gay dudes 69 is probably sweet.

[00:16:23] Not for the one on the bottom.

[00:16:25] I mean, you don't need to be on the bottom or top. You can do side by side.

[00:16:29] That's fair. Wait, no, no, that would be a Pisces.

[00:16:33] Yeah, whatever.

Joe: [00:16:35] Now we're talking numbers here.

[00:16:36] Pisces. Ah. 69.

[00:16:38] Yeah. Is there like a thing?

Frank: [00:16:40] I got to imagine there's a thing where it's like an astrology person is like 69 is loved by Pisces.

[00:16:47] Yeah. If you do it side by side, it's like, let's get in a Pisces position.

[00:16:51] Oh, there are people that, like, swear by the stars that love that shit.

Joe: [00:16:53] Yeah. I don't believe in the stars. That. It's an LED screen. Yeah.

[00:16:59] And the birds aren't real either, right? Are we shotgunning?

[00:17:03] Uh, no.

[00:17:04] If I do one, and I can prove I can do it without spilling anything, will you do one with me?

[00:17:08] No. Because, like, I'm not confident that, like, if I. If I bite the can too high, then water can just drip out.

[00:17:18] No. If you puncture it like here by the you.

[00:17:22] Yeah.

[00:17:23] You can, you can suck enough of it. And then when you put it down, if you just get it below the you, you should be okay.

[00:17:29] Yeah, I don't know.

[00:17:32] I think we should know, guys at this point in time,

[00:17:36] Like YouTube doesn't like that we have.

[00:17:38] Yeah, no, YouTube's set with us.

Frank: [00:17:39] I'd be shocked if this gets monetized in any capacity.

[00:17:43] I don't care about that. I just don't want them to take it down.

Frank: [00:17:45] Oh, I care, wait. Well, can they take it down?

[00:17:49] I don't know, bro. I'm overreacting.

[00:17:51] I don't want the episode to be gone. 

[00:17:53] Anyway. Today.

[00:17:55] Oh, don't forget what I was going to say. It's like. Joey,

Joe: [00:17:57] What are you going to say?

[00:17:57] I was going to plug the Patreon patreon.com, slash the basement yard so people could sign up. We can get us a 12,000. We can get our fucking drag show artists to come in here and, you know, make us look like beautiful drag queens, and then we can have an episode documenting the process and in full drag. But, you know, they don't want to do that. So go check it out at Patreon.com slash basement yard.

Joe: [00:18:14] Okay. Anyway, today you got a few topics. One thing that is sweeping the nation right now, folks, is a beautiful dish that people are apparently ingesting, which is a chicken dish where you take chicken and then you put NyQuil on it and. 

[00:18:34] Wait, what,

[00:18:35] You marinate chicken in NyQuil, Yeah, apparently.

[00:18:38] Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait, hold on.

[00:18:40] Nyquil. Vicks NyQuil.

Frank: [00:18:42] No no no, I know the brand. What do you mean? 

[00:18:44] Like they cook a chicken in, like.

Joe: [00:18:48] Like the blue NyQuil and make it like, blue.

[00:18:51] That seems. 

Joe: [00:18:53] Dangerous to me. Yeah, because, like, when you take, like, you know, like, drugs or whatever the fuck, what do we call that?

[00:19:02] Drugs. We call them drugs.

[00:19:03] Are they drugs?

[00:19:04] Well, it's a drug.

Joe: [00:19:05] Like a medicine, I guess. And you add heat, I don't know, does that, like, change shit?

[00:19:11] I think it'd be. I think it becomes like mustard gas or some shit. 

Joe: [00:19:15] That's wrong. Um, but yeah. So the FDA had to put out a warning because, of course, the children, they're like, oh, I saw this on TikTok and I got some views. I'm going to do exactly that because I have no fucking soul. And when I'm 32, I'm going to probably lose my mind and shave my head and move to Taiwan.

[00:19:31] Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah.

[00:19:32] That's what happens.

[00:19:33] Yeah.

Joe: [00:19:34] You don't know who you are anymore. But anyway, uh, the FDA had to put out this thing, and they said that it was warning, put out a warning about these videos and also boiling a medication can make it much more concentrated and change its properties in other ways. Even if you don't eat the chicken inhaling the medication's vapors, the gas while cooking could cause high levels of drugs to enter your body. It could also hurt your lungs. Yeah, because just sniffing this chicken,

Frank: [00:19:59] You give yourself some pneumonia. Isn't that when there's fluid in your lungs and shit like that?

[00:20:04] I mean,

[00:20:05] So here's the thing.I know the FDA came out and said, like, you know, don't don't do this. It could be bad for you. I have a possibly hot take.

[00:20:15] Do you think it's fucking sick?

Frank: [00:20:16] No, I think let the fucking morons that are doing this and dying. 

[00:20:22] Come on their children.

Frank: [00:20:24] Okay? Obviously I don't want kids to do it. Don't let kids do it, but let adults do it and let those adults die, okay? Because. You know, we need less stupid people and we need more smart people. And it's clear that we're not going to be able to educate dumb people to be smart. So why don't we just kind of, you know, you know, let the dumb people be dumb.

[00:20:48] Apparently this started as a joke. Like someone, like, tweeted out a picture of like, chicken with like, NyQuil. And then they tweeted, like, if she makes you NyQuil chicken, do not let her go. And then,

Frank: [00:20:58] Well, yeah, you can't because rigor mortis will set in and your body physically can't fucking let go of someone when you die.

[00:21:04] Yeah.Is that true? Like bodies just fucking stiffen up.

[00:21:08] Yeah, it's called rigor mortis. Your body stiffens up.

[00:21:10] But does it happen every single time?

[00:21:12] Um, I think when people die, it stiffens up for a period of time. Yes.

[00:21:17] Shiza.Dude,

[00:21:19] There's rigor mortis. Liver mortis, which is. You know what it is when your liver gets hard.

Frank: [00:21:25] No, no, no. Liver mortis.

[00:21:27] Oh, when you're hard and alive.

[00:21:28] No.

[00:21:30] Oh, you're living inside of a. 

Frank: [00:21:32] No. It's when you die. Your blood pools in the position in which you died.

[00:21:36] Pools.

[00:21:36] Pools.

[00:21:37] So what do you do? Oh, like when your hands get black and shit.

[00:21:40] No, no, no. So if you die laying face down.

[00:21:43] Yeah.

[00:21:43] And you're left like that.the blood will pool on this side of your body.

[00:21:48] Got it.

Frank: [00:21:48] So that's how they can tell what position people had died.

[00:21:51] Nice.

[00:21:52] Sometimes. And then algor mortis. Which you know what That one is, right?

Joe: [00:21:55] Yeah. Dying is gross.

[00:21:56] Yeah. No. It sucks.

[00:21:57] Dying is disgusting.

[00:21:59] What, do you have any fears?

[00:22:00] Have you seen a dead body?

[00:22:01] Yeah, I've touched one. Multiple.

[00:22:03] Yeah.

[00:22:03] Funerals and stuff.

[00:22:04] Yeah.

[00:22:04] No, I've seen like a like you seen.

Joe: [00:22:06] You've seen a raw dead body.

[00:22:07] Yeah.

[00:22:08] Where where, where.

[00:22:08] So when I was in college my senior year, I, I don't know if I could say what town it was, but probably said it before you listen to enough. You know, I interned with a police department's CSI unit. And we would get.

[00:22:22] And we got called when I was a cool guy with sunglasses, like he got left out.

Frank: [00:22:27] I got to say, the sergeant in the unit was pretty rad. The officer that I worked with, he was nice. He was pretty cool, but also not as rad as the sergeant.

[00:22:34] Did he have, like a Bluetooth thing?

[00:22:36] No, oddly enough, I did. How did you like.

Joe: [00:22:39] Damn. That's fire. No, I've never worn one of those.

[00:22:41] I want one, so yeah, I wore one. And I was told I looked like a Puerto Rican Uber driver.

[00:22:46] I damn, that's just facts is what it is.

Frank: [00:22:49] We got called the only, like, fresh in front of my face case that I saw was we got called to a homeless man that slept outside and because of how cold it was, froze. And died in the night.

[00:23:02] That is not.

[00:23:03] And then, of course, I went through, like their case files and, you know, like, looked through like some of, like, the dead bodies they had there and shit. It was pretty nuts.

[00:23:09] That's not chill. 

[00:23:11] But algor mortis. You know what algor mortis is?

[00:23:14] Bogor.

[00:23:15] Algor mortis.

[00:23:16] Algor mortis.

[00:23:17] Yeah, I know. Albus Dumbledore,

[00:23:18] You do know that. So when you die, there's rigor mortis, liver mortis and algor mortis.

[00:23:22] Algor mortis is like something about an algorithm.

[00:23:25] No,

[00:23:25] You die on social media.

[00:23:27] No, we're all dead on social media.

Joe: [00:23:29] That's a fact.

[00:23:30] It's when you. When you die, your body's internal temperature drops. I think it's like 15 degrees every hour or something like that.

[00:23:37] Get mad cold. That's why it's like I get cold.

Frank: [00:23:39] Well, that's why that could be like, you know, they can look at a body and be like, oh, the body's 20 degrees. You know, it's 20 degrees cooler, which means it's been here and died maybe for like an hour and a half. Oh, you know, you see,

Joe: [00:23:50] Bro, you're serving like education.

[00:23:52] I got you, babe. Listen, I went to school for this shit. I got my education in this shit.

Joe: [00:23:56] Yeah.Thanks for telling us about the mortis brothers or whatever it was.

[00:23:59] Yeah. The Morty. Morty boys.

[00:24:00] The Morty boys, was it? 

Frank: [00:24:04] Algor mortis, livor mortis and rigor mortis.

[00:24:09] Sweet. 

[00:24:10] That's pretty rad. 

[00:24:11] Now we know more about the dead, but it is still gross.

[00:24:13] Yeah.

Joe: [00:24:14] Always finding a dead body is probably like, oh, ill.

[00:24:16] I feel bad when I found it because he was like a homeless Hispanic man and he was frozen.

[00:24:20] I was like. His mouth was open, his mouth open.

[00:24:24] Don't make jokes about dads.

[00:24:26] No one knows who this man was.

[00:24:27] I know, but he knows he's watching you, dude.

[00:24:30] He ain't watching, bro.

[00:24:31] He.

[00:24:32] They don't have.

Frank: [00:24:32] They don't have TVs and.

Joe: [00:24:33] No. Whoa, dude, dude, imagine ghosts are real and they're just watching you.

[00:24:41] That'd be fucking weird.

[00:24:42] Like if there was just, like, there's, like, random ghosts that we've never had a conversation with. Just hanging out in here.

Frank: [00:24:47] I think we'd know because, like, we've talked enough about our dead relatives that they'd be like, yo, chill, chill, chill,

[00:24:53] My grandpa come near this place.

[00:24:54] You don't think so?

[00:24:55] No.

Joe: [00:24:56] My grandma would be like. She would hear me say, come and be like, no, that's it.

[00:24:59] Really? 

[00:25:00] Your grandma was a prude.

Joe: [00:25:02] She was just like a very old fashioned Irish broad.

[00:25:05] So proud.

[00:25:06] I guess. 

[00:25:07] They thinking about the fact that your grandma had to just get down.

[00:25:10] Yeah. She's like on rails.

[00:25:11] Isn't that wild?

[00:25:12] I know. 

[00:25:12] You think old people, like, at that age suck dick, bro.

[00:25:16] Yeah, I do think so.

Frank: [00:25:17] Um, they were too classy for it. They'd be like, oh, not in my mouth.

Joe: [00:25:21] No, no. No, I think they do, dude. Old people probably get crazy. And that's the thing, bro, when you get old and you're like, bro, I'm kind of like, in ten years, I could be fucking dead. Like, my shit is up, you know? Like, we walk around and like, anyone could die any day, but like, when you're fucking 80, you're like, oh, any second now.

[00:25:43] Yeah.

[00:25:44] You just happen.

[00:25:44] You're playing with you're playing with house money at that point in time.

Joe: [00:25:46] So that's why I think that like, old people are probably just like, whatever, roll the dice, I'll fucking, I'll get fisted or something.

[00:25:52] No, no, no, I'm not saying when they're old,

[00:25:54] I'm saying that.

Frank: [00:25:56] I'm saying you ever look at like an old person and just be like, yo, when they were like,

[00:25:58] Oh, when they were in their prime?

[00:26:00] Like when they were. Yeah. When they were, you know, like,

[00:26:02] No, no, no. People were fucking disgusting back then.

[00:26:04] You don't think so?

[00:26:05] I don't think they showered less.

[00:26:06] I think people like, you know, like they were. 

Joe: [00:26:08] They all had sex and had cigarettes in their hands.

[00:26:11] Oh, well, that's where that comes from. Like afterward they'd be like, light up a cigarette.

[00:26:16] Yeah. So a guy with a bush on, like a soft dick and he's like, give me a beer.

Frank: [00:26:21] I got to say, men in the 60s and 70s, even parts of the 80s, they weren't helping their selves with bushes. Dude, I remember once. Well, I'll tell the story, I don't care. This isn't Patreon, but I don't care. I'm drinking.

Joe: [00:26:33] Right. Before you get to that, let's get to the ads for today. Oh, what time we have for today? The first one being I don't know if they'll like that. The first one being Stitch Fix. Stitch fix is like having your own personal stylist. Okay, you go on to Stitch fix.com, you fill out a style quiz and you tell them, I like this kind of fit. Here's my sizes, here's my height, my weight and my waist or whatever the hell the sizes that you usually wear. Do you wear a relaxed fit? A slim fit? You fill out all this stuff and then after you're done with that, they start picking items for you. And I believe it's monthly and maybe that's that could change. But you get a box delivered to your house with about like five items and, um, you only pay for what you keep so you get stuff based upon what you would they think you would like. And then you go, okay, these this is cool, this is cool. And then you send these things back and it's free returns, free shipping. And again you only pay for what you keep. So it's really cool.

Okay, so go do that. Frank.

Frank: [00:28:44] What?

[00:28:45] What were you going to say?

Frank: [00:28:46] Oh, I just thought about. I don't know if I should say this.It was a bush. I'll say it. Yeah. I once found one of my dad's porn tapes. Not like of my dad,

[00:28:56] Bro.I was about to be like, go get it.

[00:29:00] Not like of my dad, but a tape of porn that he had.

[00:29:03] What was it on? Was it on like a. 

[00:29:04] VHS?

[00:29:05] He had a VHS porno?

[00:29:07] Yeah.

[00:29:07] Where was it?

[00:29:08] It was in his dresser.

[00:29:10] It was like in his sock drawer.

[00:29:11] Yeah.

[00:29:12] That's where my dad's Playboy magazine was.

[00:29:14] Fire.

[00:29:15] Maybe that was just like a thing back then.

[00:29:16] I think it was.

Joe: [00:29:17] All the secrets were in there.

[00:29:18] Yeah.

[00:29:19] If you think your husband's cheating on you, just check his sock drawer.

[00:29:21] Yeah, and I remember I popped it on. Had to take a look for, you know, I had to take a I had to see.

[00:29:27] So you waited. Wait, what did what did it say on it?

[00:29:30] Nothing.

[00:29:30] It was blank.

[00:29:31] Why did you watch it then? How did you know what it was?

[00:29:33] I didn't, I was. 

[00:29:34] You were just like, I need to watch this tape.

Frank: [00:29:36] I was like, what is this here for? I need to check it out.

[00:29:38] Really?

[00:29:39] Yeah.

[00:29:40] Huh. Weird. Are you prepared to see your dad's cock?

[00:29:43] Sorry, dad. I'll tell story.

[00:29:44] You ever seen your dad's dick?

[00:29:45] Yeah. Dude, I've told this story millions of times.

[00:29:47] Oh, yeah, that's right.I forgot. 

[00:29:48] Dad was dicks out all the time.

[00:29:50] That's crazy.

[00:29:50] Yeah, I'm scarred for it.

[00:29:51] When was the last time you saw it, though?

[00:29:52] You saw us recently?

[00:29:53] Uh, no.

[00:29:55] It's been a long time.

[00:29:57] Six years?

[00:29:59] No way longer.

[00:30:00] Oh, ten years, way longer.

[00:30:02] Damn it. I was trying to get, you know. Okay, so what was on the tape?

[00:30:05] Porn.

[00:30:06] Yeah.

[00:30:06] What kind? 

[00:30:07] Like, just like sex.

[00:30:08] I know what porn is.

Frank: [00:30:09] Sex. Porn.

[00:30:11] I know,

Frank: [00:30:11] But what I'm getting at is, like, they all had full bushes, and, like, the guys look like shit.

[00:30:16] Like, the women had cool bushes.

[00:30:18] Women bushes were sweet. 

Joe: [00:30:20] Because they were, like, puffy.

[00:30:21] Yeah, they were like, sweet, you know? Like they made you feel like there was a there's a homey feel about them, you know what I mean?Like, you feel at home.

Joe: [00:30:28] They looked like like you want to just go like this to them.

Frank: [00:30:33] Yeah. I mean, you you want to, as you tell me all the time, grab them by the pussy. That's what you said.

[00:30:38] That wasn't me.

[00:30:39] That's. That's what you just did.

Joe: [00:30:40] No, you're confusing me with your hero.

[00:30:42] No, not my hero.

[00:30:43] Yes.

[00:30:44] Not my hero.

[00:30:44] Yes. No, no, you told me. 

[00:30:46] No.

Joe: [00:30:46] Yo, you used to FaceTime me every day and salute. And really. 

[00:30:50] Did I did, I was that before or after you called me and told me to wake up and pull myself. Myself up by my bootstraps?

[00:30:55] No, that. The fuck are we doing here? We're like two beers in.

[00:31:03] Yeah.

[00:31:04] You want to go more? You want to go more?

[00:31:08] I just open this.

[00:31:08] I'll chug this whole bitch right now.

[00:31:10] Okay, I believe you.

[00:31:11] Yeah.I'm sad, I don't care.

[00:31:14] Damn, dude. You.

Frank: [00:31:16] Uh oh. Who's calling?

[00:31:17] No. I was going to smash a bug.

Frank: [00:31:19] Oh, I caught a fly earlier.

[00:31:21] That's one of the best feelings in the world.

Frank: [00:31:22] It literally just went. And I was meeting with an attorney. I was like, what would you do if I told you under this hand there's a fly She's like, pretty cool. I just went like that and it flew away.

[00:31:32] Damn.

[00:31:32] Her answer didn't make me want to kill it as bad.

Joe: [00:31:34] What'd she say?

[00:31:35] Pretty cool.

[00:31:37] Yeah.No.What a bitch.

Frank: [00:31:39] Take it easy.

[00:31:40] She was watching.

Frank: [00:31:40] That's not very nice. I mean, I hope not, but if she is, she's a nice woman.

[00:31:44] She's going to sue me.

[00:31:46] She might get you. 

Joe: [00:31:47] Anyway. Nyquil. Chick. Chicken?

Frank: [00:31:48] Yeah. What the fuck? Honestly, let the people do this. This doesn't even sound delicious.Nyquil was my least favorite. Kaufman.

[00:31:55] Is it?

[00:31:55] Now, if they had that bubblegum Motrin, children's Motrin chicken.

[00:31:59] That's my favorite medicine of all time.

[00:32:02] I might if they had bubblegum.

Joe: [00:32:18] Um, that was my favorite medicine. And I used to take it by syringe for some reason, even though. What was the point of that?

Frank: [00:32:25] I think the syringe is meant to scare kids.

[00:32:31] Oh, that sounded like you had more to say.

[00:32:32] No. That's it.

Joe: [00:32:34] No, I remember when I would when kids were sick in, like, when we were in, like third grade or something, and they would come to school and they would have the syringe with the. 

[00:32:41] I'd want it. Yeah.

Joe: [00:32:42] I'd be like, fuck, dude, I'm mad jealous. That shit tastes mad good. I used to I'm not going to. I'm dead serious when I say this. When I was younger and I was sick, I would get the medicine from my mom and I was like, that shit tasted so fucking fire because it was bubblegum flavored that the next day, even if I was feeling better, I was like, I don't know,

[00:32:58] You want a little bit? Yeah, you want a little bit more?

[00:33:00] You know, I didn't really know the effects of medicine.

Frank: [00:33:01] That's how I was with. And cough drops, the cherry flavored.

[00:33:04] I'll eat a cough drop right now for no reason, dude.

[00:33:07] But not any cough drop like Ricola. It'll, like, put fucking hair on your chest like those. 

Joe: [00:33:11] Ricola's wild bro.

[00:33:12] Who the fuck has those and thinks like, delicious?

Joe: [00:33:15] I'm like eating a hot rock. It's like I'm eating exactly what you put on top of hookahs. That's what I feel like every rekopis. I'm just like taking one of those and I'm like,

[00:33:22] That's exactly what they are.

[00:33:23] Hot.

[00:33:23] They put the hot coals, they took it off of a hookah. Fucking.

Joe: [00:33:27] Yeah. And then you package it up and called it Ricola.

[00:33:29] No, but those Luden's babe, when they're like, oh, this is medicine. I'm like, dude, I know candy, I know candy, that's straight candy.

[00:33:34] It is.

[00:33:35] And the cherry flavor don't give me fucking like I had orange flavor ones. Now listen, they weren't that bad, but that cherry flavored candy. Straight candy.

[00:33:41] Yeah, it's. Oh, the OG one is fire.

Frank: [00:33:43] I remember on the packet it was like, do not exceed three per 24 hours I was like, bro, I have three in a sitting also.

[00:33:49] That makes me feel like my throat is so slick. Yeah, like you drink water after having one of those and the water is just like, yeah. And I'm like, yo, I'm just gonna keep taking them.

Frank: [00:33:56] It's fucking rushing down your throat.

[00:33:58] Yeah.

[00:33:58] Just like coming everywhere, rushing down your throat. And it's fucking. It's getting there hard.

[00:34:03] Yeah. What, what? Take it easy. You're saying a lot of sexual.

[00:34:07] No no, no. Not saying sexual things like the way you said.

Joe: [00:34:09] Come in hard straight down your throat when you drink water, when you have the cough drop.

[00:34:13] No.

[00:34:13] What I was saying.

[00:34:14] I know what I'm saying, too.

Joe: [00:34:15] Apparently not.

[00:34:16] Uh, you're doing you're being inappropriate. Honestly. Wildly inappropriate for a for a fucking YouTube episode that people have access to the public.

[00:34:24] What are you even saying now? You're talking about things rushing coming down your throat. That's what you said.

[00:34:29] No, I said, when you drink water,

[00:34:30] Take it easy.

[00:34:31] When you drink water, that's what happens. You think they'll let us into the Yankee Museum?

[00:34:38] Probably not.

[00:34:38] You think they're going to let us in?

[00:34:39] It's not the first time we've been thrown out of Yankee Stadium.

[00:34:41] You have been thrown out of Yankee Stadium? That's right. 

Joe: [00:34:43] On TV.

[00:34:45] I've never been thrown out of Yankee Stadium.But you have.

[00:34:49] I didn't get thrown out of the stadium.

Frank: [00:34:50] One of my favorite Yankee Stadium got tossed out of the section. One of my favorite Yankee Stadium memories was I went to a game in 2007. The Yankees were playing the Cardinals. No, not the Cardinals. The Cleveland. 

[00:35:00] Doesn't matter. Unnecessary. Go ahead,

[00:35:01] The Guardian. No, it is necessary.The Guardians. But they were the Indians back then.

Joe: [00:35:06] I want to say this real quick, and I just wanted to be on record, which I don't know why I wanted to be on record, but I just want to say,

[00:35:12] Well, it's going to be on record regardless of what you say.

[00:35:14] It's being recorded.

[00:35:15] Yeah.

Joe: [00:35:16] Uh. I know that logo was like offensive, but it was kind of cool.

[00:35:21] It was a pretty sweet logo. 

[00:35:23] I know his name was even more offensive. It was Chief Wahoo. Nonetheless,

[00:35:27] Why was that offensive?

[00:35:28] Because it was.

[00:35:30] Oh, like. Whoa! And they were like, yo, it's not a real.

Frank: [00:35:33] They were simulating Native Americans, not fucking Super Mario on World three one. Joey. I mean, Wahoo!

Joe: [00:35:41] I'm just saying, like, I've been on record when I was younger being like, yo, that's the coolest.

[00:35:46] No, not the coolest logo.

Joe: [00:35:47] No. To me, I thought it was.

[00:35:48] Although the G with the flying. That's pretty cool. I think now too, but nonetheless playing the Cleveland at the time. Indians now Guardians and Travis Hafner. You remember that fucking meathead?

[00:35:58] No.

[00:35:58] Was in the on deck circle and I was sitting right next to the on deck circle, and I was being like, no one loves you. Your family hates you. Your wife is cheating on you. I was a fucking piece of shit 14 year old.

[00:36:08] You were that close?

[00:36:08] Yeah.

[00:36:09] And he heard you.

[00:36:10] Yeah. We got this kid and I went to the game and convinced the, like, a security guard to let us sit there. He was like, bro, if no one comes, these seats are yours. We were like, sweet. We stayed there the whole game.

[00:36:20] Wow.

[00:36:21] And we were. We were like talking shit to him. He was pissed. Boy, he was not happy with us.

[00:36:26] You told him that his wife was cheating on him?

[00:36:28] Yeah, but worse. Probably worse things too. I was like, yo, your kids suck. You suck, suck, suck.

[00:36:34] How old were you?

[00:36:35] 14.15?

[00:36:36] Wow, that's a good age.

[00:36:38] Oh, fuck him.

[00:36:38] That's prime heckling age, I would say.

Frank: [00:36:40] Yeah, it was pretty good because. What are you going to say back? I'm going to beat you up. 14 year old. I was like, do it, Travis Hafner.

[00:36:45] Yeah.

[00:36:45] What do you know?

[00:36:46] Yeah. Make my day pay for my college right now.

Frank: [00:36:48] Literally pay for everything that I want in life right now.

[00:36:52] Yeah, honestly. Speaking of. A weird foods, NyQuil chicken, whatever. Also in the news there was these new there's a new potato chip on the block. Oh yeah, I heard you can think of good flavors, but I bet you would never guess that this flavor.

[00:37:11] Is pussy.

[00:37:12] Yeah.Oh, yeah.

[00:37:14] We got pussy flavored chips.

[00:37:15] Pussy flavored chips. Now, listen, potato chips come in a variety of flavors I've seen.

[00:37:20] What's your favorite potato chip?

[00:37:21] Honestly.

[00:37:22] Hold on, because I'm gonna catch it.

[00:37:25] Catch that bitch.

Joe: [00:37:26] This. This is going to be clipped. So I need to start this because I just want to.

[00:37:30] Yeah.

[00:37:30] Okay.

[00:37:30] Can you drink more? So I feel like I'm less of a loser.

[00:37:36] Yeah. Hold on, hold on one sec.

[00:37:41] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh!

Joe: [00:37:48] Holy shit.

[00:37:49] Joey doesn't burp either. So that's sitting right there.

[00:37:52] Sitting right here. It's going to blow out the back.

[00:37:53] What if I.

[00:37:54] Oh, no, that doesn't make me gag.

[00:37:57] All right.

[00:37:58] Um, what's your favorite potato chip?

[00:38:04] Hey, ridged.

[00:38:07] All righty.No.

[00:38:08] Yeah.

[00:38:09] Ridged is the worst kind of chip.

[00:38:11] No.

[00:38:11] All righty.No.

[00:38:12] No way.Better. 

Joe: [00:38:13] Ridged.What?

[00:38:14] Ridged? Sour cream and onion.

[00:38:18] You were close because cheddar and sour cream is better than that.And that's the only ridged chip that will. Ridge is whack. This shit is hard, bro.

Frank: [00:38:26] No, I like it more because, like, it's more like put together, like, you see it and you're like, that's a good that's a well put together chip.

[00:38:31] No, no, no, I see it. And I'm like, this is going to hurt my mouth.

[00:38:33] You have the mouth of a fucking infant. What's wrong with you?

[00:38:35] Oh, you complain about Captain Crunch fucking cutting your fucking mouth, Joey Rich, chip is legit. I could kill someone with one.

Frank: [00:38:41] Every person that has Captain Crunch knows that's what it does.

[00:38:44] It does a little, a little, but not more than a ridged chip. I eat those, it's like I'm eating nails.

[00:38:50] No, dude, do you have fucking molars? you should be able to figure it out sometimes.I put the Captain Crunch in my mouth and the, you know, crunches, the crunch berries get away from my teeth a little bit.

[00:39:01] Chips are way more sharp than those.

[00:39:03] They are sharp, but not ridged chips.

[00:39:06] Your favorite chip is.This is what is it? Sour cream.

Frank: [00:39:09] My favorite chip or my favorite type of, like flavor chip? My favorite.

[00:39:14] That's legit. The same question.

[00:39:16] No flavor sour cream and onion. My favorite chip, period is dipsy doodles.

[00:39:21] Yo, let me tell you something.

Frank: [00:39:23] Yeah.Tell them baby. Yeah.Let him go.

[00:39:25] The worst fucking like of all Your favorite chip is dipsy doodles.

[00:39:30] How is that? The worst chip of all time? That's the best type of chip.

Joe: [00:39:33] That chip is such a legit fucking garbage, I can't even.

[00:39:39] Are you fucking kidding me? How was it? The best people love Fritos. I can't believe you're serious right now. You're 100% serious that you think dipsy doodles are the worst.Chip,

[00:39:54] I'm hoping you're joking.

[00:39:55] Please tell me that you're going to say something like fucking honey barbecue, you fucking loser.

Joe: [00:40:00] When I open up the bag to dipsy doodles, I feel like it's taking air from me. Like the smell suck so much that I feel like I can't breathe.Like I'm like, what is that?

[00:40:12] It's perfectly salty.It has a nice consistency to it.It's a corn chip. 

[00:40:16] And it's a childish name.Dipsy doodle.What are we at?Circus?Be an adult.

Frank: [00:40:21] It keeps the childlike wonder of chips. You open it. What do you want to open? A bag of Lay's potato chips, like. Oh, sweet. Go live in Idaho, you sad fuck. I want dipsy doodles where I'm going to open it and be fucking joyous the whole time.

[00:40:34] Lay's is the worst chips too. 

[00:40:35] They are.

[00:40:35] They don't like they're fucking plain,

Frank: [00:40:37] I would say. I would say, what's the one with the girl on it? Just no ridge ridges. I like the ridges from. Ouais, ouais, ouais. Chips, I take it back.

[00:40:47] Ouais, ouais.

[00:40:48] Ouais.

[00:40:49] Ouais sucks.

Frank: [00:40:51] Dude, what do you like?

[00:40:53] I don't know,

[00:40:53] What do you like?

[00:40:54] It lays might be better. 

[00:40:55] What do you consider a cheese doodle? A chip? Because I love cheese doodles.

[00:40:58] I'll be honest. Why is this a joke? I think I think they're a joke, I think so. 

[00:41:05] How. How do they. How are they a joke?

[00:41:07] I'm pretty sure they're a joke.

Frank: [00:41:08] No they're not. They're a good chip. They make great sunflower seeds, too.

[00:41:13] They make sunflower seeds.

[00:41:15] The green skinny bags,

[00:41:16] That's them.

[00:41:17] That's them.

Joe: [00:41:18] Okay, I like those.

Frank: [00:41:22] I'm blown away right now. What chips do you like then? You fucking psychopath. If you say something like hers, I'm going to put my head through the fucking wall also.

[00:41:30] The hell is that?

[00:41:31] Also, I'm sorry I got to back up a little bit. I think my favorite type of chip is salt and vinegar. I like little salt.

[00:41:38] You do like that?

[00:41:39] I do, and it turns the inside of my mouth raw, like fucking Monday night.

Joe: [00:41:43] Yeah, you like that? Your lips get all fucking.

[00:41:45] They do. They get like white.

[00:41:46] Yeah, yeah.

[00:41:47] Like I have thrush or something. 

[00:41:48] I used to, I thought I used to hate salt and vinegar chips, but now I like them. I like them for some reason.

[00:41:58] All right. Chips, salt and vinegar.

[00:42:00] I like a, I like a cool ranch Dorito. 

Frank: [00:42:02] Cool Ranch Doritos are good, but don't consider it like a Doritos are like fast food in a bag. They're not.

[00:42:08] Those are chips,

[00:42:09] But they're. Careful.

[00:42:10] They're legitimately chips.

Frank: [00:42:11] They're like chips. Plus, you know what I mean? Like, you get chips, you get YouTube and YouTube. Red Doritos are like YouTube red, you know what I'm saying? They're a little more higher up.They're a little more upper class. Okay. That's normal. People have to have fucking like, flat out the bag. Just shitty like. 

[00:42:28] Normal people Chips Literally $0.25.

[00:42:31] Not anymore.

[00:42:31] 35.

[00:42:33] You remember we used to be able to go to the store, get a barrel, drink a bag of chips and a cosmic brownie for a dollar.No good days.

Joe: [00:42:42] Yeah. Also, cosmic brownies are like. All right, you know what I don't like? They're okay. They're okay. Yo, you know what? You know, this is a hot take. People are not going to like this.

[00:42:52] Hotter than cosmic brownies being all right.

[00:42:55] Yeah, I have, I have a. 

Frank: [00:42:56] What do you fucking eat, you loser? Ding dongs.

[00:42:59] Ding dongs? Uh, no. My mom loves Ring Dings, though.

[00:43:03] Yeah, your mom is an idiot. We know that already. But you we had hope for, you know,

[00:43:09] Here's a hot take.

[00:43:10] Laz, I love you. You're not an idiot.

Joe: [00:43:11] People are not going to like this.

[00:43:13] I don't like this conversation as it is.

[00:43:15] Hold on.

[00:43:15] I'm ready. Another beer in me. I might jump across the table and strangle you.

[00:43:18] Listen,

[00:43:19] You fucking bastard.

[00:43:20] Yo, rainbow cookies are fucking trash.

[00:43:23] They're good. I wouldn't sit there and say. 

[00:43:24] They're wack.

[00:43:25] Yo, why? Italian people fucking love them. And I'm like, these suck,

Frank: [00:43:29] Bro.Italian people are weird. They're like, oh, I have this beautiful cookie with almond paste. And I'm like, get the fuck out of here.

[00:43:36] I just think that, like, there's so much hype around the rainbow cookie and it's like one, I don't like foods that are multi-colored and have one flavor.ur fucking with me.

[00:43:44] Joey really just likes white colored things. He doesn't want multicolored things in his life.

[00:43:49] Now you're starting with this shit.

[00:43:51] You said it.

[00:43:52] I'm saying foods.

[00:43:55] Gotcha. I'll meet you halfway with this. Rainbow cookies aren't bad per se, but there are a lot. Dude, it's like a meal I don't like. It's like eating a Snickers. It's a whole fucking meal.

[00:44:06] Even a small yo. Also Snickers. Overrated kind of wack. I had a Snickers the other day and I was like, this is not I didn't even. I took one bite and I was like, I'm done, I. 

[00:44:15] Bro. Exactly. I have a Snickers and I'm good for the whole day. That's breakfast, lunch and dinner.

[00:44:19] Nugget wack.What is that?

[00:44:22] It's all right.

[00:44:23] It's like eating a fucking.

[00:44:24] It's like space food. It's not real. 

[00:44:25] It's like eating like a Tempur-Pedic mattress.

[00:44:27] Yes. That's exactly.

Joe: [00:44:28] It's like this is what mattresses are made of.

[00:44:30] Yes. Like when people like, when they make the nugget in the factory, they people put their hands in it and go back and go watch.See,

[00:44:35] One time I forgot who it was. It may have been like a stranger at a bar who was. 

[00:44:40] Nelson Mandela?

Joe: [00:44:41] No, no no no. Close.

[00:44:42] Okay.

[00:44:43] It was someone at a bar, and I.

[00:44:47] Some beers are flowing

Joe: [00:44:50] Nelson Mandela. So one time I asked someone what their favorite candy bar was and they said, Three Musketeers. And I swear to God, I thought about. 

[00:45:00] Murdering them.

[00:45:01] Yeah,

[00:45:01] The whole family.

Joe: [00:45:02] Yeah.  thought about killing their whole family around them. So they had to watch.

[00:45:07] They had to watch it.

[00:45:08] And then killing them at the end of that.

[00:45:09] I like Three Musketeers.

[00:45:11] No, I don't,

[00:45:12] But if I ever said it was my favorite, just know that I'm like on the verge of death.

[00:45:18] I will not eat one,

[00:45:21] I'll eat one,

[00:45:22] I will not, no, no, no,

[00:45:23] I won't eat a full one. I'll eat the little Halloween ones.

Joe: [00:45:26] No one will eat a full three Musketeers.

[00:45:28] That's like one step further. I'll take it one step further. I don't think I've ever seen a full sized Three Musketeers bar.

[00:45:33] Because it's too much.

[00:45:34] Because it doesn't exist.

Joe: [00:45:35] Also, in those bags where they have three musketeers, they also have Milky Ways, which is the supreme.

[00:45:41] Milky ways are very, very good.

[00:45:43] The best bar shaped in that way. That's a. 

[00:45:45] No no. Hold on. The best. The best chocolate bar is Twix.

[00:45:50] That's not a that's not what I mean. I mean, like a chocolate bar. 

[00:45:53] With the dick vein.

[00:45:54] Yeah.

Joe: [00:45:55] Like bars.

[00:45:56] You know, the dick vein.

[00:45:57] I would say even a hundred grand is better than fucking Snickers.

[00:45:59] Yeah. Tell me about your dentures too, you fucking hag.

[00:46:03] It is an old.

Frank: [00:46:04] Yeah. I was like, what do you want? I want 100 grand. When Becca and I were dating, she was like, oh my God, I can go for a peanut shoe right now. And I was like, who the fuck are you?

[00:46:13] What?

Frank: [00:46:14] And what fucking retirement community do you. 

[00:46:15] Wait, she said, peanut shoe.

[00:46:16] Yeah. 

Joe: [00:46:17] And you guys got married.

Frank: [00:46:18] We did. We did get married. Yeah. Honestly, I forgot about the peanut chewing to the very moment.

[00:46:24] She's going to on the full when you get home.

[00:46:26] Relationships on the rocks now.

Joe: [00:46:28] Peanut, shoo!What a.

Frank: [00:46:30] Well, it's all right. One of the people in this room have openly admitted to eating Charleston Chews. And the other.

[00:46:36] I was just going to bring that up because I know you hate them.

[00:46:38] And the other person in this room is me.

Joe: [00:46:40] Yeah. they're not bad, it's just like marshmallow.

Frank: [00:46:45] You're like mallomars.

[00:46:48] Yeah,

[00:46:48] I do like mallomars.

Joe: [00:46:49] Yeah. My mom used to buy those, like, out of nowhere. She'd be like, oh, like, out of nowhere. I remember like, because they would disappear, like, half the year, and then all of a sudden she'd be like, it's mallomars season.

[00:46:57] I'm a big fish. I'm a big well, I'm a big fan of like during Easter, how they have just like, marshmallows covered in chocolate and you bite into it.

[00:47:06] Oh, I don't like that because that chocolate is fucking garbage.

[00:47:10] It's not great chocolate, but it's it's the ratio from marshmallow to chocolate is enough.

Joe: [00:47:14] Why is there so many different fucking chocolates? Just make chocolate. One thing, two things. Dark milk. That's it. What do we need more chocolates for? White chocolate.Garbage.

[00:47:26] Shut up!

[00:47:26] Garbage!

[00:47:27] Shut up!

Joe: [00:47:27] Easily the worst.

Frank: [00:47:28] Shut up! I agree. No I don't. Dark chocolate. Dark choc is way worse, bro. When I'm having dark chocolate, I feel like I'm having a cup of coffee. It's like, who the fuck? Why did I smoke 12 packs. 

[00:47:37] So rich? It's so.

Frank: [00:47:39] It is very, very rich and bitter.

[00:47:40] White chocolate is.

Frank: [00:47:41] But here's the thing. I, I kind of agree. I kind of don't agree because during like Easter time, I grew up in a block where there were like super religious people, you know, you go across the street from the church and stuff.

[00:47:50] God bless.

[00:47:51] And people would give out the, like, white chocolate like fucking roses for Easter and shit like that. And I loved them so much, but I like them more. If they didn't call them white chocolate, just call them what they are and it's sugar water paste, that's it.

Joe: [00:48:04] There's no chocolate,

Frank: [00:48:06] There's none. It's sugar and water.

[00:48:08] Really?

[00:48:09] Yes.You didn't know that. Wait wait wait wait. Stop stop.

[00:48:13] I didn't know the chemical breakdown of white chocolate. No!

[00:48:15] Stop, stop!You thought white chocolate was chocolate?

Joe: [00:48:18] I thought there was some element of chocolate in there.Yes,

Frank: [00:48:20] I'm going to. I'm going to be the person to break this to you. You're a stupid idiot,

[00:48:23] Frankie. I don't I think that most people would think if I'm being told this is white chocolate, I have to assume that it's chocolate. Sorry I didn't do a fucking. By the way, the first time I learned about with white chocolate was I was fucking eight. So forgive me for not growing up and doing hard research on figuring out what's the chemical compound.

Frank: [00:48:45] Joey, what is this? Actually, not all frogs are toads, and all toads are frogs. You hear what I'm saying? Like you're just sitting here putting yourself in a situation where you're going to fucking make yourself sound more dumb. If you didn't know that white chocolate was not chocolate, what is wrong with you? You know what I found out the moment I looked at one of those fucking Hershey's cookies and cream bars. I'm always been a gum guy. I'll still be a gum guy to the day I die.

Joe: [00:49:13] Top three gums,

[00:49:14] Big League Chew watermelon.

[00:49:16] That's one. 

[00:49:17] Bubble tape.

[00:49:19] Okay.

[00:49:20] Bubblicious Watermelon.

[00:49:22] I'm sensing a Oh, wait. Bubble tape.

Frank: [00:49:27] That's number two.

[00:49:27] You love that.

[00:49:28] I love bubble tape. I haven't had it in quite a while.

[00:49:31] Were you the one that would bite the side of the fucking thing?

Frank: [00:49:33] We would do it. Joey. Do you? I have a picture of you and I putting a whole roll of bubble tape in our mouth and chewing it.

[00:49:39] I remember that picture. Yeah,

[00:49:41] I was in a marshall Faulk jersey.

Joe: [00:49:43] It was the times. 

[00:49:44] Joey was in a white tee that went down to his knees.

[00:49:48] It was, um, do you want another beer, dude?

[00:49:55] Um, wait, I thought you said you like Juicy Fruit.

Frank: [00:49:57] I do like Juicy Fruit, but I wouldn't put it top three.

[00:49:59] Yeah.

Frank: [00:50:00] Number one, without a doubt, is Big League Chew watermelon. I'll die for that gum.

[00:50:04] My nephew's birthday recently. my nephew's birthday recently was baseball themed, and my sister bought a bunch of Big League Chew.

[00:50:16] Yeah, it's bad.

[00:50:16] And then, like, Cracker Jacks and, like, other shit. But, like, I was like, yo, this chew is coming home with me.

Frank: [00:50:30] Big League chew is my tobacco like I put it in my lip. I keep it there. And I fucking told you. I was like, you know, that's my tobacco. I know that's what it's meant to look like.

[00:50:39] I don't know what my favorite gum is. I don't fuck with dentyne ice because that shit is so fucking fresh.

[00:50:44] It's cold bro man.

Joe: [00:50:45] Cold bro cold. Also, they have sexual ass commercials. It's like, yo have this gum and a girl is going to ride. You like, what the fuck are you talking about,

[00:50:52] Bro? I used to get horny for the fucking five gum commercials, remember? It was like what it's like to chew five gum, and it's like a girl riding a fucking vibrator in the middle of, like, a fucking stereo.

[00:51:02] What is that?

[00:51:03] It doesn't make any sense.

Joe: [00:51:04] It's like dark and like, there's, like, techno, and it's like, dude, we're talking about gum here.

[00:51:07] What it's like to chew five gum, and it's someone, like getting a fucking flamethrower in their ass. Like. Oh, like it didn't. It was very sexualized.

[00:51:15] Yeah, I know we're all, like, having fun and, like, making stuff up, but like, that one concerned me. Like, what are you talking.

[00:51:19] It wasn't me. It was the commercial.

Joe: [00:51:20] I'm pretty sure that wasn't the commercial. The flamethrower in someone's ass.

Frank: [00:51:27] The infamous orbit commercial, obviously.Right. who you calling a cootie queen, you lint licker?

[00:51:34] Yeah, that's classic. 

[00:51:36] Like orbit,

[00:51:36] I don't mind. Orbit? Orbit was the one that I was pranked on. People told me they were like, oh, you could eat the paper. And I was like, all right. so I chewed like a whole pack with paper, like a fucking idiot.

Joe: [00:51:46] Why? The whole pack seems like a little.

[00:51:48] Well, not all together. One piece at a time.

[00:51:51] Oh, wow. You're an idiot.

Frank: [00:51:52] It was dumb.

[00:51:53] You just called me an idiot.

[00:51:54] Well, you are too. Don't be confused. Do you remember in fucking high school? By the way, this episode off the rails. We shouldn't drink on episodes anymore.

[00:52:01] Yeah. That's cool. I'm going to get to these ads. We have two ads left, folks. The first one.Okay.

Joe: [00:54:55] Uh, also, one thing I want to point out, I know that we got completely off track, but these pussy chips, pussy flavored chips,

Frank: [00:55:03] They're made in a white country like Scandinavia or Norway or some white shit.

[00:55:06] I'd love to tell you where they're made, but this site is in a completely different language.

[00:55:11] It is.

Joe: [00:55:12] And I can't read anything. Also, these these chips, by the way, limited edition.

[00:55:17] And we also tried to buy them and they don't ship to the US.

[00:55:20] No preservatives which is huge.

[00:55:22] Well well then what. 

Joe: [00:55:24] I don't know, their pussy flavor and their 18 plus. So if you're 17 you can't eat a pussy chip. That sucks.

[00:55:34] That's kind of wack, dude.

Joe: [00:55:35] Why is that though? Why you suck at 17, right? Wait, is there a legal age too?

Frank: [00:55:39] I don't know what country this is in, but I don't think it's like, oh, I should probably not say this, I don't know. And this is actually me legitimately asking if you're a 17 year old and you're engaging in. 

[00:55:53] Hello, be easy.

[00:55:54] I'm saying, like if you're 17.

[00:55:57] Yeah,

[00:55:57] In the US, the way it works, if you are 17 and you engage in consensual sex with another 17 year old,

Joe: [00:56:04] Are you breaking the law?Is that what you're asking me?

[00:56:07] Yeah, yeah, that's kind of what I was asking, too.

[00:56:09]  I don't know, I think maybe, like, I'll tell you what.

Frank: [00:56:11] Statutory charges, if that's the case, lock him up.

[00:56:15] I broke the law.

[00:56:16] Yeah, lock him up, baby. I'm not dapping you up.

Joe: [00:56:18] Why?

[00:56:18] All right.

[00:56:19] You lost your virginity before you were 18, too.

[00:56:22] No, I didn't lose my virginity. I met my wife, Joey. This guy.

[00:56:28] What an idiot.

[00:56:31] This guy loves to try to say I'm a virgin.

[00:56:37] Your tongue is freaking me out.

[00:56:38] And honestly, I saw it. I was like, that's a little too purple.

Joe: [00:56:42] Can I ask you a question?

[00:56:43] Sure.

[00:56:44] Never mind. You're not going to answer it.

[00:56:45] I probably won't be asking anyways.

[00:56:47] You ever have sex in a school?

[00:56:52] No, no. Absolutely not.

[00:56:54] Me neither.

[00:56:54] I've absolutely not.

Joe: [00:56:55] I've made out in a school. That's pretty much it.

[00:56:57] Oh, I've made out hard in school.

Joe: [00:56:58] I think I touched a vagina in a school once.

[00:57:02] In a school? In the confines of.

[00:57:04] I was in Spanish class. I was in eighth grade,

Frank: [00:57:11] You horny little whore.

[00:57:12] I know, and I touched a vagina.

[00:57:14] You're a bad little bitch.

[00:57:15] I know.And then. And then I remember.

Frank: [00:57:17] What was it like? Did it feel like mac and cheese?

[00:57:19] It felt like I was, like, going crazy. What? What you said. feel like mac and cheese.

Frank: [00:57:28] I don't know what you're talking about.

[00:57:29] Um, well, I'm talking about vagina.

[00:57:31] Yeah, I know,

[00:57:32] I know that, you know, uh, but I remember doing it. And then, like, a couple of days later, her friend was like.She said, it was like, the greatest sexual experience of her life. And in my head, I was like, wait, I would hope we're in a we're in eighth grade. Yo, do you know one time I don't know if you know this story, but my in eighth grade, our Spanish teacher. Right. She was also my homeroom teacher. Uh, so I don't know if.

[00:58:24] What was it? Michi.

[00:58:25] No, that was sixth grade or. No, that was seventh grade. Uh, uh, her name was Miss Rosenblatt.

[00:58:32] Another not appropriate Spanish teacher.

Joe: [00:58:36] Yeah, well, I don't know what she was, to be honest with you, but she fucking hated me. But I wrote in her yearbook at the end of the year.

[00:58:43] My teachers hated me, too. Don't worry, dude,

[00:58:45] In eighth grade, I wrote like, it's been such a pleasure being in your class. And I wrote Dot dot dot psych and big. I was an idiot,

[00:58:50] Dude, you got her so good, I fucking flamed her, crushed her.

Joe: [00:58:53] But anyway, so in that class we had, we had a substitute, right? This woman, Miss Gomez, and she would come in, and. 

[00:59:00] She seems more appropriate for a Spanish class.

[00:59:02] Yeah, she was, like, very nice, too. And I felt so bad this happened to her. But like, in the back of our classroom, there was like a kitchenette thing and and we found out because I sat near it that like, if you like, it became like loose. So we just started unscrewing it slowly. Right? And like, water was pouring out of it like a little bit. And we kept doing it and kept doing it because people would get up and they would get water in the middle of class all the time. Then one time this kid, what was his name? Shamir. His name was Shamir, right. And he's like, can I go get water? And we at this point, we had unscrewed the shit like a lot like me and a couple of my friends. This kid goes to drink water and the thing just snaps off and it shoots up at the ceiling like a geyser. And you know how the ceilings of classrooms were like that? Like cardboard. Yeah, right through that. Like that's how strong it was, bro. Teacher runs over and tries and puts her hands over it.

Joe: [00:59:59] She's soaking wet.

[01:00:00] Big mistake.

[01:00:01] I'm literally sitting there like this, like, Holy fuck yeah. And there's water going everywhere.

Frank: [01:00:05] You just ruin the structural integrity of this whole building.

Joe: [01:00:08] they flooded like half of that floor? It was incredible.

[01:00:12] Wait. The floor,

[01:00:13] The floor, bro.

Frank: [01:00:14] Why wouldn't they just turn the water off? Joe?

Joe: [01:00:16] I guess no one knew how to do it. Yeah, I don't know. I was just like, yo, I was like

Frank: [01:00:24] You're a menace.

[01:00:25] I was like, yo, look, I didn't do it. First of all, Shamir, technically,

Frank: [01:00:28] Do you want another one?

[01:00:29] I have one right here.

[01:00:30] You're a menace, dude.

[01:00:33] But there was, like, water everywhere. There was like an inch. There was like, this much water on the floor

[01:01:16] Yeah.

[01:01:16] It was.

[01:01:17] Oh, you said you had a sharp penis.

[01:01:19] I'm getting it.

[01:01:20] Got to be honest with you.

[01:01:21] Yeah, this is starting to blur the line.

[01:01:22] And I know you guys are thinking, like he's only had three beers.

[01:01:26] I don't drink anymore.

[01:01:28] But also, you had some beers before that.

[01:01:30] Un.

[01:01:31] Yeah, but it was a 9% beer.

[01:01:33] This is true.

[01:01:34] I don't drink anymore.

[01:01:35] Yeah, I have children now.

[01:01:37] And I know that if I drink, I'm going to be miserable the day after.

[01:01:40] So I don't do it right.

[01:01:41] But special occasions.

[01:01:43] Yeah.

[01:01:43] Like my birthday when we had that big bottle of wine.

[01:01:46] Oh my God, that was a fat.

[01:01:47] Nick Nock I am surprised we finished that.

[01:01:50] I'm not.

[01:01:50] That was actually not bad.

[01:01:51] We had a couple, you know.

[01:01:53] You know, I think I drank a lot of that fucking wine.

[01:01:55] Lushes at the table between me, you, Keith Lynch and Asbo gets going.

[01:02:00] You start talking to me about golf.

[01:02:01] He'd be like, oh, he'll drink all night.

[01:02:03] Yeah.

[01:02:03] Espo had everything he needed.

[01:02:05] Talk about golf, wine and meat.

[01:02:07] That's all he needs.

[01:02:07] Then he had a cigar at one point and a literally.

[01:02:10] I don't know how it's going to get in a collared shirt.

[01:02:11] He had.

[01:02:12] He was in his fucking glory.

[01:02:13] Yeah.

[01:02:13] That was you could have died the next day.

[01:02:15] It's true.

[01:02:15] I almost died that night.

[01:02:16] The air in that fucking cigar lounge.

[01:02:19] Did not bode well with my lungs.

[01:02:21] Yeah, I don't know that I could survive in one of those.

[01:02:24] It was really nice.

[01:02:25] It was really, really nice.

[01:02:27] But it was.

[01:02:28] It was.

[01:02:28] The air was thick.

[01:02:29] Yeah.

[01:02:29] I had to go to the bathroom and outside, like 2 or 3 times.

[01:02:32] So you did piss outside.

[01:02:34] No, no, no.

[01:02:34] To the bathroom and outside.

[01:02:37] Oh.

[01:02:37] Oh, I thought you meant piss outside.

[01:02:39] No, no, I piss in the bathroom.

[01:02:40] I went outside for fucking.

[01:02:41] By the way, I meant to say this before, but when I left the bar to go pee in that alleyway, I was greeted by a bunch of rats.

[01:02:48] Did you pee on them?

[01:02:49] I didn't pee on the rats.

[01:02:50] I didn't want to upset them and have them run at me.

[01:02:53] Well, I don't think they would run at you.

[01:02:55] I'm a very afraid of rats.

[01:02:56] Yeah, rats.

[01:02:57] I don't tend to be like.

[01:02:58] Oh, you know, like scared.

[01:02:59] I'm afraid rats are big.

[01:03:01] They're basically cats.

[01:03:02] Yeah.

[01:03:03] And if you get bit by one of those, you might as well just kill yourself because there's no coming back from that.

[01:03:09] Yeah.

[01:03:09] You got all of New York City's biggest diseases right in you.

[01:03:13] People always say like, oh my God, like the rats in New York City.

[01:03:17] And it's like, there are rats.

[01:03:18] But like, I've not seen enough to be like, whoa.

[01:03:23] Yeah, I understand what you're saying.

[01:03:25] Like, there definitely are rats.

[01:03:27] But the thing is, like, if you see four rats, like, if you go out in Manhattan one night, right, bro?

[01:03:32] If I see four rats in a day, it's a fucking anomaly.

[01:03:35] It's Christmas time.

[01:03:38] It's Christmas time.

[01:03:39] No, but like, if I'm in Manhattan, like, all night, like you're out till, like, 3 a.m.

[01:03:44] or 4 a.m.

[01:03:45] or something.

[01:03:46] You'll definitely see one one.

[01:03:49] But like, people are talking like, you go in the subway and you see a fucking like a subway surfing rat.

[01:03:55] I mean, I used to take the train to work all the time.

[01:03:58] I would say that like at least three times a week, I would see a rat.

[01:04:02] I would see one maybe once a week.

[01:04:03] And that was when I was taking it all the time.

[01:04:07] Nappy nap.

[01:04:08] If I slow down, I will need to nap.

[01:04:10] But I'm not going to slow down.

[01:04:11] You can't.

[01:04:11] I mean, at this point, I mean, once I start drinking, once I stop, but yeah, yeah.

[01:04:17] So let's just not stop.

[01:04:18] Let's get there and just buy stuff.

[01:04:21] Hats, jerseys.

[01:04:23] You said stuff.

[01:04:24] What do you mean?

[01:04:25] Just like items?

[01:04:26] Yeah.

[01:04:26] You don't want to buy drinks?

[01:04:29] Buy a jacket.

[01:04:30] You want to go buy a jacket?

[01:04:32] Want to buy that Yankee leather jacket that has all the World Series patches?

[01:04:36] Frank, don't be a piece of shit.

[01:04:38] Oh, man.

[01:04:38] Anyone who wears a Yankee jacket with all the patches on it is a fucking asshole.

[01:04:42] Are we?

[01:04:43] Yeah.

[01:04:43] No, that's like having the Yankee, like, uh, tattoo on your calf.

[01:04:49] I feel like every fat Yankee fan has that.

[01:04:54] Got him?

[01:04:54] Nope.

[01:04:55] He flew away.

[01:04:56] Yeah, am I wrong?

[01:04:57] You know any fat Yankee fans?

[01:04:59] Tons like Danny Leprieuri.

[01:05:05] Not fat anymore.

[01:05:05] He actually looks pretty good.

[01:05:06] I got to say, he lost a bunch of weight.

[01:05:08] He did lose a bunch of weight.

[01:05:09] Not fat anymore.

[01:05:10] Um, I'm thinking of white people, though.

[01:05:13] So, am I in the Spanish person conversation?

[01:05:15] Do you consider me fat?

[01:05:17] And.

[01:05:17] No.

[01:05:18] Why did you say like that?

[01:05:19] Just.

[01:05:20] No.

[01:05:21] Yeah, I don't I don't say.

[01:05:22] All right, so let's redo that.

[01:05:24] Do you consider me fat?

[01:05:25] No.

[01:05:25] Thank you.

[01:05:26] You went.

[01:05:27] No.

[01:05:27] Like like there's an argument there, but I'm not going to I think that some people would be like, yeah, dude, bro, fucking someone would call me fat.

[01:05:36] It seems like someone's insecure.

[01:05:38] I'm not insecure, I just I'm upset.
