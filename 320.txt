Joe (00:00:00) - You that these are five and we had such a funny conversation too because I told her I was like the podcast knows who you are Yeah, like she's pretty famous on this show. Frank (00:00:07) - I was like, yeah, we talked about you all the time Well, she's pretty famous on this show she said that one time she saw a clip or something or maybe listen to a part of the podcast where we Were talking about because we were talking about the three horsemen Jane Jane Jamie and Gillian So three horsewomen. Yeah of our childhood So she said she's like I forgot about who they were. Joe (00:00:29) - She's like so my younger self was like She still got it still got it, you know what fires there let's fire never burns out completely I mean the fire still burns, you know for young preview Bess and Joey. I mean, I don't blame her You're a cute kid big teeth. I had big teeth. You had big teeth. I guess so and it's also bigger than me She was quite tall and she was fast. She was very fast. She was also real good at basketball. Frank (00:01:00) - She's good at basketball, dude I remember she once like broke her arm or something Some shit and you were like, yo, how'd you break her arm? I was like, oh she dumped on someone in basketball I do like believed it For a hot sec, you're like, oh, I was like no she like fucking fell or some shit So I want to read you there's a poem here. Joe (00:01:21) - That's called my wishes and it's like I wish my oh man Here we go again, Joey. Frank (00:01:25) - I wish I don't die Literally, there's one. Joe (00:01:27) - Okay, I Wish for my grandfather in heaven because he is special to me. Frank (00:01:32) - That's not even like that doesn't even make sense What do you wish for? Yeah, I wish for everyone to have a better place to be Honestly, though not a bad wish I wish you were somewhere better I just yeah, are you content because I wish it was just better for you No one's the best like little like backhanded compliment a backhanded diss that like people it won't like register with them right away Right, and then they walk down the block. They're like, wait a fucking second. I was just telling how happy I was Yes, I wish more. Joe (00:02:00) - Oh my god, you have kids and you're married. I wish better All right, so the reason why I brought this up is there's a different poem that I wrote here. Oh, it's not a poem That's so weird. I have two poems too. Okay I don't know if this is a poem as much as it is just like a little blurb that I wrote. Frank (00:02:16) - Mm-hmm And I'll get to why it's very funny but It's called my grandfather. Okay. It says my grandfather was very special to me. He played with me all day Can I ask a question? Joe (00:02:30) - Nope, I'll get to it at the end I think I know what you're gonna ask. Okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna get to that So I wrote my grandfather was very special to me. He played with me all day all day He helped me with my homework. Frank (00:02:42) - That was cute. This is why he is special Pretty pretty basic. Okay after he died. Joe (00:02:48) - I felt lonely Damn now every day. I pray to him even though he is in heaven. He will always be in my heart. That's cute I will never forget my grandfather. Frank (00:02:58) - That's adorable, dude. Joe (00:02:59) - So I wrote that right? Frank (00:03:00) - Yeah, so she sent me that One of the things that's funny about this is that there's little pictures Yep of a man with a cane and one of them says two times two is four five times six is thirty and I was like Thank you, and that's like a picture that I drew. Hey, man, spot-on Then there's a picture of me of a stick figure standing over a box With a another stick figure laying there with a cane and two X's in their eyes Drew this guy's dead. Yeah with the cane. He went with the cane now. That's not even the funniest part. Joe (00:03:32) - Okay, the funniest part About this whole thing, which I had to I went to my mom's house early this morning just to have this conversation My the my grandfather on my dad's side on my mom's side I never met yeah, so he died before I was born. Mm-hmm That's that was Gonna be my first question, right? No, so he was I never never knew him didn't care and now this grandfather that I'm talking about that You know was very special to me.  He played with me all the day and you know when he died He will always be in my heart. This is like When I was in maybe fourth or fifth grade. Frank (00:04:07) - Yeah My little grandfather didn't die until... I Called my mom I was like when did grandpa Santa got all died Fucking second dude, I never but my grandpa also when he was alive lived in Maine Never saw you shot a shotgun once with him and he came back down. Joe (00:04:33) - You're like, I'm good, bro I I saw my grandpa on like fucking Christmas Easter Funeral And I went up there one time I remember when he went up there cuz you shot a shotgun Yeah, and I was just gonna say I was gonna say hold on a sec as someone that yeah knows you and your family I was like, who the fuck is he talking about grandpa? No grandpa, and and I didn't I never met your dad's father Yeah, something tells me if he is the father of your dad. He didn't know five times six.Frank (00:05:05) - Probably not. Probably not.  Maybe 2x2. 5x6? That could be a tricky one. Joe (00:05:10) - Yo, my grandfather was so fucking funny, dude. Frank (00:05:13) - Was he? Joe (00:05:13) - Yeah, oh my god. Frank (00:05:15) - I remember there was one time that I was, uh... We were watching football, someone got a hit or something, and he goes, Oh, that guy's paralyzed. Like, dead serious. And we're like, the fuck? No, he's not. He's fine. He's like on the ground, grabbing his knee. Obvious paralyzed job. Like, he's just, like, fucking ignorant. Just double tripling down. But I was reading this thing, and I'm like, I read it, as she sent it to me, I'm like, oh my god. And the reason why it was funny to me at first, because I was like, the other stuff too, I was talking about death, and I was like, and then I was explaining to her, I was like, I was writing about death in, like, middle school too. Like, it was so weird. And then I'm like, wait, what the fuck is this? Frank (00:05:52) - And, like, that's just a big old lie. And you called me a liar as a kid, you fucking piece of shit. I did lie about my grandfather being dead. Which, I didn't lie, technically he did die, but years prior. Yeah, I mean, that's a lie. Well, no, it wasn't a lie. That was the reason I didn't do a month's work of homework in sixth grade. Joe (00:06:08) - Got it. Frank (00:06:10) - But I had no idea. I asked my mom, I was like, am I crazy? Like, he died when I was in high school. I'm like, who could I be writing about? The only grandparent that I had, like, a close relationship with... Joe (00:06:20) - Was your grandmother. Your mom's mom. Frank (00:06:22) - My mom's mom. Joe (00:06:23) - Yeah, I remember. And, like, you know, maybe she did this stuff with me. I mean, she wasn't fucking, you know, playing football with me or anything. Frank (00:06:30) - Yeah, well, she couldn't. She wasn't very agile. Joe (00:06:32) - No, she was an old bag. Frank (00:06:34) - So, she sent me two poems as well. Yeah. And one of them is just okay. Joe (00:06:41) - Did you write about a fake death also? Frank (00:06:42) - No, I didn't. No one fake dead in mind. Joe (00:06:45) - The only thing that I can possibly think of is that I... Did you ever have, like, a relationship with, like, someone you called grandpa or something? Frank (00:06:54) - No. No one in your life that, like, it was, like, pseudo-grandpa.  The only thing I can possibly think of is if they, like, assigned, like, write about this member of your family. Joe (00:07:07) - Like, someone got brother, someone got mother, and I got grandfather, and I had nothing to write. Frank (00:07:11) - So, I wrote that. But that also just doesn't make sense to me because one of them was dead, so it's, like, fine, whatever. But the other one was, like, very much alive. And I could have wrote about him and just lied and not killed him. Joe (00:07:19) - You did. Frank (00:07:21) - So, like, either way, this is cut. Joe (00:07:23) - Full dead. Frank (00:07:24) - Psycho, bro. Joe (00:07:25) - Like, to the point where, like, you drew him dead. Frank (00:07:27) - Drew him dead. Joe (00:07:28) - Maybe you were manifesting... Also, a cane? Frank (00:07:30) - My grandfather never had a cane. Not once. Never had a cane. Joe (00:07:34) - Maybe this is, like, just, like, a memory you've completely forgotten where, like, you were, like, cool with, like, an old man who used a cane. I hope not. I hope not. That sounds terrible. If you forgot it, it's for a reason. Yeah, burying something. So, I wrote two poems. The second one is the real, like, party poem. The first one, though, I might as well read so you can get a sense because we haven't gone through any of my poems yet. Frank (00:07:57) - First one is My Father. Joe (00:08:00) - Buckle up. Frank (00:08:00) - It's gonna be... Joe (00:08:02) - And I don't know. Frank (00:08:02) - I think this was supposed to be in, like, different lines because it's, like, it's made like an idiot. Joe (00:08:08) - Right. Frank (00:08:09) - How he works 24 hours a day, comes home to sleep. Joe (00:08:13) - Huh? That's how you started it? Frank (00:08:16) - How he... You wonder why you weren't student of the month. How he works 24 hours a day, comes home to sleep. Joe (00:08:25) - How the... Frank (00:08:26) - That doesn't even fucking make sense. Joe (00:08:29) - The math doesn't add up. It doesn't. Frank (00:08:30) - He comes... He works 24 hours a day and then comes, like... Joe (00:08:34) - What? Frank (00:08:34) - I can't. The way he says, try, try, and try until you get it. Listen, my dad's never been the very motivational one. Joe (00:08:43) - No. Frank (00:08:44) - And if he was, he, like, stumbled into it by accident, you know? Joe (00:08:48) - He'd be like, well, guess what? If you can't do it, maybe Don, maybe do it. Frank (00:08:52) - And it's like, oh, okay, Dad. Okay. You know? Most of all, the way he combs his hair until it shines. Joe (00:09:00) - I don't know. Frank (00:09:01) - I don't think that hair... That didn't line up. Joe (00:09:02) - I don't think that's how hair works. Frank (00:09:04) - But don't forget, if he is young or old, I'll still love him. Jesus Christ. And then I drew... Drew you, Dad? It's not good. Joe (00:09:15) - Yo, that sucks. Frank (00:09:17) - That looks like nothing. Joe (00:09:18) - It was bad. The other one, though. I had to just read that just to give you a sense as to where... Frank (00:09:22) - A precursor. As I can... What my words can do. Joe (00:09:25) - 100%. The other one. Give it to me, baby. Frank (00:09:27) - This is called courage.Joe (00:09:29) - Oh my God, I cannot wait, God, please, God. Frank (00:09:33) - And I drew a picture of the sun and someone throwing a baguette, maybe? I don't, a roll of sourdough. Joe (00:09:41) - I'm not quite sure what that is. Frank (00:09:42) - So littering is courage to you? Joe (00:09:44) - I guess so. Bro, I used to litter all the time back in the day, dude. All right, courage. Frank (00:09:51) - He helps me when I'm in trouble. Joe (00:09:53) - Not bad. I get, you know. Frank (00:09:55) - That's when courage arrives. Joe (00:09:56) - That's when courage comes out. Frank (00:09:58) - Tells me to go when my brothers need help. Joe (00:10:00) - Huh? Frank (00:10:01) - What is this, a lassie situation? Joe (00:10:03) - I guess so. Like what is courage gonna do? Frank (00:10:06) - Is courage now an actual person? Joe (00:10:08) - I guess so. I thought you were just being like- I think I'm talking about my dad here again. Frank (00:10:11) - Oh, I thought you were being like metaphorical, like courage, he comes to me. Joe (00:10:14) - I think, maybe, I'm not sure. Cause then I go, he wears dark red. Frank (00:10:18) - Why? Joe (00:10:18) - Why does he wear that color? Frank (00:10:20) - Wait, hold on. You just made up a man named courage? Joe (00:10:23) - I guess so. Frank (00:10:25) - He wears dark red. Joe (00:10:26) - Tells me to go when my brothers need help. What was happening with my brothers that they needed my help? Frank (00:10:30) - I don't know. Joe (00:10:31) - They were okay. Maybe he will show me the right and wrong thing to do. Frank (00:10:36) - That's nice. Joe (00:10:37) - This last line. Frank (00:10:38) - Boy, buckle up. Joe (00:10:44) - Wherever I go, he needs to follow me. Not living outside of me, inside of me. Frank (00:10:55) - What the fuck? You probably thought you crushed that. Nailed it, dude. Joe (00:10:59) - Courage is not living outside of me. Frank (00:11:01) - This was a call for help. So you have- There was someone trying to fuck me and I was trying to tell the school. There was There was a man in dark red. Fucking telling me to help my brothers and he's going to fuck me. Help, courage is inside of me currently. Literally, I think if you take like the last couple words, it's like trouble, help, red, red. Conspiracy theorists would just have a fucking field day with that. This might've been like a fucking like a little way to like tell people like a cryptic, like national treasure way to like tell them I'm in trouble because the last words of each line are trouble, help, red, do me. Joe (00:11:40) - Do me. Frank (00:11:46) - I was like, oh shit. Joe (00:11:49) - Trouble, help, red, do me. Do me. Wait, maybe that was part of the assignment. Frank (00:11:54) - Cause that was the last of yours. No, no. I need to end in trouble, help. No, mine were- I think the son is the trouble, is the courage here. Joe (00:12:06) - And I think that's me. Frank (00:12:08) - And that's- That just looks like a pair of tits. A manhole cover? Joe (00:12:14) - Pair of tits with legs? Maybe. Frank (00:12:17) - Boy, but when I read that, I was like, oh. Joe (00:12:20) - He is inside of me. Frank (00:12:21) - Not living outside of me, inside of me. Joe (00:12:24) - Inside. Frank (00:12:25) - Some people would be super into that. Joe (00:12:27) - But yeah, Jamie said that to me too. Frank (00:12:28) - I was like astonished. Cause I don't think I had seen a poem of mine since ever. Joe (00:12:34) - Yeah, no, that's amazing. She really came through with that. Oh man, we did well. I miss it back in the day. Frank (00:12:38) - We did well. Do you think right now, if I give you a topic, do you think you can write a poem?

Manhattan's an island too, but we grew up in Queens, which is an island, yeah, but also they're from Florida, which is like, yeah, they're not an island. Yeah, they're Peninsula boys. Yeah, they're Peninsula boys. They like happen to grow up in like the archipelago boys maybe, yeah, maybe, like you know, marshland boys, yeah, definitely not island boy. Frank (00:21:16) - Yeah, we're also, I think we might be, island boys. Joe (00:21:20) - We are more island boys than their island boys by the definition of that they're giving. Yes, I'm not gonna. They want to identify as island boys. Good for them, yeah, but the way that they're going about defining them, yeah, we're more island boys. Yeah, then damn, yeah they're. You know they're Peninsula boys, they are Peninsula boys, which is cool to listen. I do not judge. Frank (00:21:45) - I I love Peninsula boys. I loved Peninsula boys, Penicilla boys, Peninsula Penicill boys, penis boys, penis, uh, okay, I, all I'm saying is, by their definition, they just, they just ousted themselves, they out of themselves. Joe (00:22:07) - They did. Frank (00:22:08) - They can call themselves island boys. Joe (00:22:09) - But if they're saying, like yo, you need to be this to be an island boy, I guess they're the exception of the rule, because there's always one or two. I guess, yeah, but they're twins, right? Yeah, so they're one, they're one human, just in two different bodies. No, that's what twins basically are. It's like the same DNA. If they're identical, well, they do have some sort of same DNA- actually crazy. Can you do me a favor and just like lower that? Frank (00:22:33) - I can do it? Of course you go ahead and talk. Joe (00:22:38) - I saw a video on the talk- are you good? No, but I saw a video on tick-tock of a guy who had a twin brother who was a criminal and like stole a car or something. Like we have your, some of this DNA matches your DNA. And he's like: yeah, we're twins, we have some matching DNA. I didn't even know that was true. Well, identical twins have the same DNA. Yeah, yeah, they were. It's just fraternal twins of different DNA. So, like my brothers are fraternal twins. Do you know what? Do you know? Frank (00:23:07) - Like the scientific like reasoning behind being identical and fraternal? Same cock, did I know? Joe (00:23:16) - No, same looking place they all come from. Frank (00:23:17) - No, it's like a scientific thing. Joe (00:23:19) - Oh, same chromosomes? Frank (00:23:21) - No, no, the fucking same molecules. Joe (00:23:24) - Am I again? Mitochondria? Keep going. Frank (00:23:26) - That's the powerhouse of the cell baby. Or a plast. Joe (00:23:28) - That's definitely implants. All right, it's the. What's the habit? Homeostasis, what did you call me? I've exhausted all scientific terms that I know that. Frank (00:23:42) - You know the fraternal twins are two different eggs and identical twins are one egg that's split. Joe (00:23:49) - Oh damn, yeah, yeah, yeah. Frank (00:23:51) - So like that's why, like, only like same-sex twins can be identical, like you can't have like a boy and a girl that are identical twins, gotcha, because they come from the same fucking egg word. You sure like that. Joe (00:24:02) - So I don't even know, but we are more island boys in their island boys, yeah, and I will say you know, like I, from from what I've seen, I mean I don't really know these kids- I will say that they look like they got a lot going on, they've had a lot going on, but they look like nice kids. If I'm being, I hope they are, I I don't know, though I wish I mean they did say you know, in there they said like they're Crippen. Frank (00:24:28) - Did they crip in there? It sounded like they were saying they're crippin. Oh, well, and that's not good I mean, I don't have a problem with the cribs. I don't have a problem with them at large Yeah, no, but like please like don't become a gang member. Well, it could lead to bad It really depends what kind of gang bang what kind of banging you do the banging don't know bang bang But like you could bang and like hang out with the boys. You want to go bang out later? Joe (00:24:50) - You know what? I mean? Yeah. Frank (00:24:51) - Well, I mean that that works, you know, it's exactly it's the banging that defines the gang So if you're gonna be sitting there and you're gonna be, you know banging like, you know, clip-clop. Yeah That's not a good bang. Yeah, bang in a fun way. Yeah, you know cuz like in college you were in a fraternity It wasn't a fraternity like it was a white gang There's like a there's like a fraternity where it's like, you know We're gonna go out and we're gonna like, you know girls and pee on each other. Joe (00:25:16) - Yeah finger our brothers Yeah, whatever and then other fraternities are just like, you know, we're just gonna recycle That's what we did and we're like nice and like wear the same shirt whole doors open for people wear ties and you know recycle Yeah, it's like it's a it's a resume. There are other ones out there. They're like, yo bend over I'm gonna smack you with this fucking piece of wood. Yeah. Yeah. Frank (00:25:35) - Yeah, not me So like I think you can gang bang in a very like, you know for the community I mean religions are gangs, you know Think about like gang like, you know The Christian gang Christian gang like if they want to go out there and do Christian gang bang Like that's cool if they want to be like, you know, praise God careful Praise God, but the bad Christian gang bang. I Think you've said enough But we don't know what kind of gang bang and they're doing. Yeah, there's always good I mean, that's a metaphor for like everything in life. Joe (00:26:05) - There's always gonna be a good gang bang and a bad gang bang There is someone that tweeted at me once like enough with disrespecting God. I was like Wow, I Almost let loose on this guy. You're gonna know what you did. Tell on me. Yeah, I Gotta be careful because my in-laws are you know, they're they're they keep a good line of connection with God So I don't want to disrespect them but like this person almost got it on Twitter Well, you know it is what it is. What so Do we know what they do? Are they rappers? Can I be honest with you? Frank (00:26:37) - Yep I don't I can't tell you the last like legitimate like rap artists that I've listened to that has come out past 2010 And I'm not saying there are no good ones, right I'm not disrespecting I know like, you know people really love J Cole Kendrick Lamar, you know, that was before that. Okay, I didn't know but what I'm saying is like That wasn't good No, no I mean, they're not well I don't know that they have like rap music out like I don't really know if you look it up They should make that song though. It would be a fucking hit. Joe (00:27:11) - I could almost guarantee they had at least one song out I'm sure they do but you know, it's like it was all like Island boy. I'm a CC boy. I'm a deep deep boy. I'm a Rolls-Royce boy They're Rolls-Royce boys. That's very nice. That's a good boy to be I don't think that they have a Rolls-Royce though If they do that's an impressive boy. I mean, yeah, that's a big fucking boy. That's a man You don't have a Rolls-Royce. No, I do not you won't have one anytime soon unless you want to how much is it? Frank (00:27:43) - I think a Rolls-Royce goes for like Like 200 I would say at least 250 300 Jesus Really like Rolls-Royce. I don't like him either. I would say a Bentley is cool, though I think a Rolls-Royce is cool. If you have a driver but like to drive that on your own side Yeah, it's like a Maybach like who you don't like a point of a Maybach is to sit in the back not in the front Roy's rolls Take it all's Royce cost Now they're 300 dog yeah 300 that sounds about right are they worth it though the 2021 Rolls-Royce ghost Nice car. Joe (00:28:18) - It's three hundred and three hundred twelve thousand dollars. That's like the standard edition I mean the inside is like you're in a spaceship, you know, like it looks let me see that But these these two are Rolls-Royce boys. I Mean that looks okay, and then you have like the stars That looks cool. But like what's the difference between that and what you have right now? You know what I mean? You would hope not $300,000.

You ever look at a professional and think I could fucking kill you? You know what's funny. Joe (00:34:18) - So like you know how- like I mean I don't know how connected you are to the internet and trends or whatever, but like you know how it's like a thing with like women who are like, oh, if you're under six foot, like I'm gonna call you friend. Frank (00:34:28) - You think I'm disconnected to the point where I don't fucking know that. Joe (00:34:31) - I don't know, bro, okay, like these trends that come in and out, they're like tik-tok. Frank (00:34:34) - We live on the internet, our life is the internet, I know, but you don't like do the tik-tok thing. I don't have tik-tok, you are correct, but Becca probably keeps you up to date. She does. Joe (00:34:42) - So, yeah, so it's like that whole thing like six foot and under whatever, and like there's always these dudes that are like 5'10 and being like yo, I'm not right now. There's actually a really funny thing that I really enjoy it's these girls going to random guys Instagram lives and being like, yes, we love a short King. Frank (00:34:56) - And then dudes like losing it, like bro, I'm not short, I'm, like I mean I'm 5'9, but like that's not short, bro. People like I think, people legit think that you and I are like 5'5 and 5'4. Yeah, like they're like yo, these two are fucking tiny and you know what, let them think I don't even care, like I don't really care. Yeah, I mean, like what are you gonna do? Hurt my feelings? Joe (00:35:16) - Those things are so funny to me, because dudes just being like bro, I'm not short, like I'm, and then like that just makes it worse, bro, like it's, it's one thing to be short, but it's also to be short and like bitter, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah. I mean, if you're actually short, you're funny, like it's able to be manipulated into like defending yourself. It's funny like you've got to become like self-deprecating if you're actually short. Frank (00:35:38) - So you know, obviously, you know, my actual opinion is like girls who say stuff like that, like, oh, if you're under six foot, I'm gonna call you friend, oh, I won't even look at you, whatever, like obviously that's like dumb, but but it's. It is funny that if I go into my gay persona, mm-hmm, I'm like, oh, I think, I think and I see, that's what. Joe (00:36:05) - I don't know, I don't have first degree or firsthand knowledge, but I would assume that, like in the gay community, it's like you're either massive or you're a little beep, beep, like they don't like anything in between. They want you to be like a little twinkie twink or they want like a big old, twunky bear. Yeah, you know what I mean, mm-hmm, and I think that's why I'll to. They would do well in that regard, you know. Or you can look at like someone like Frank Thomas, he probably. Oh, that's a big guy. Yeah, fucking David Ortiz, hot guy. Frank (00:36:33) - Why, big hairy dominican- hair gay man's dream. Big hairy Dominican, that's a gay man's dream. Let me tell you, take it from me. Well, I mean, maybe I've been trying to say I've been gay my whole life. I was telling about courage. Living inside of courage is courage to come out. Courage is come, try to come out, amazing. All right, let me get to these ads right here. Joe (00:37:02) - All right, we have fit bod for all the bears out there that want to become twinks. You guys can use fit bod. Fit bod creates a program based on unique body experience and environment. Their algorithm uses data and analytics to help you build on your last workout to maximize your results. Frank (00:37:19) - It is an awesome thing because, like I said- I've said this before when I read this ad- but it's very important that when you are like sticking to a workout program, they run for a certain amount of weeks, but sometimes people make the mistake of just doing the same workouts like every time they go to the gym, or they follow the same program for like two years, which is gonna. It's not the optimal way to work out, so they. Joe (00:37:41) - So the fact that they use the algorithm to build on your last workout to maximize results is really smart. You know- and they also do it- whether you're exercising three days a week, twice a day or you know whatever. Frank (00:37:52) - So they have kind of like you know the minimum and the maximum. Joe (00:37:57) - Obviously, if you're working out more than two times a day, like that's psychotic. Also, two times a day is kind of overkill. But anyway, also, if you don't have equipment, they have bodyweight routines for those who are looking to get fit at home or on the go. It's super easy to use. They have HD video tutorials to make learning new exercises a breeze, so you can do it like on your own in your living room, no one around. Frank (00:38:16) - And even if you don't have equipment, it's definitely for you still, and they'll figure out a way to make sure that you're building on your last workout and getting you know optimal results. Joe (00:38:25) - So it's great. So it integrates with other fitness apps like Apple health, Fitbit and Strava. Personalized training can be tough on the budget, but FitBot is only $9.99 a month or $59.99 a year. Frank (00:38:36) - Sign up now and you get 25% off your already affordable membership. Joe (00:38:39) - All right, so 25% off your membership if you go to FitBotme slash basement. Frank (00:38:43) - That's 25% off at FitBotme slash basement. Joe (00:38:47) - Definitely go check them out.

This kid's just- I just don't- And I love how- Did you see the picture of them on the rollercoaster? Joe (00:43:36) - I did. Frank (00:43:36) - And the girl in front of it? Joe (00:43:37) - Yeah. Frank (00:43:38) - It was like, jeez. Talk about no one reading the room. Joe (00:43:42) - Bro, going to a rollercoaster ride with a- I'm getting a call from Albany. Pick it up. I'm afraid. Frank (00:43:51) - Okay. But going on a rollercoaster ride and holding hands, like, oh my god, I'm so scared. Joe (00:43:57) - Oh, man. Frank (00:43:57) - That's a flirty thing to do. And that's also a dangerous date. Have you ever been on, like, an aggressive rollercoaster? Joe (00:44:03) - It's a lot of like- Why is that dangerous? Frank (00:44:06) - Because, like, it's- Did you watch the new episode of Curb? Yeah. Did you see where he's like, oh, what'd you hit the glass? Joe (00:44:14) - Oh, yeah. You know? Frank (00:44:14) - And it's like that. Like, remember I told a story about, like, the girl I went tubing with and she, like, bounced off the tube and was like- And you were like, that's it. That's it. It's done. Forever. Joe (00:44:21) - Yeah. Frank (00:44:22) - Same thing. If you fucking- You hear a wrong grunt, you don't- And, like, Kim Kardashian, like, carries herself really well.Joe (00:44:29) - Well-spoken, you know, like maybe she screams in a roller coaster like an idiot like you're, like i don't know about this, you don't know, like that's where, like the inner. Frank (00:44:39) - That's so true, though, because there was one time that i i had sex with this girl and she, oh, okay, yeah, oh, i've had sex with girls before- for me to go, so i had sex with this girl and she was very good looking, but then, like, she made very weird noises, really like give me, give me two of the noises. They were very animal, like yo yo, yo, yo, no, they were more like no, no, no, they were more like grizzly. No, like grizzly, we're getting warmer now. Like i was actually clear in my throat. I was gonna say that wasn't a noise. Joe (00:45:17) - Yeah, she's going to the doctor, that's pure comedy. Yeah, no, but she was just like, and i was like oh, and i remember like, if there was a camera on me, i remember being like really, yeah, and like it was fine, she was very nice. Frank (00:45:31) - It's so funny that like, but i was like i really do think that that expectation- you know how like people are, like oh, porn is ruined, like kids, and like blah, blah, blah- i really do think like the idea of like what moaning should, like the sounds during sex. I think that i think that is has been ruined by porn because, like, we don't know like about, hey, i hate porn sound. I well, listen up. I'm saying, like we don't know what sounds were like pre-porn. What videos were there? Well, yeah, you know what i mean. Joe (00:45:59) - They could have just been like, yeah, you know like people could just like, super like what a fucking guy is getting like railed from the back. He's like, yeah, when what guy's getting railed from the back? Frank (00:46:10) - Oh, we're talking about we're in greece now. Joe (00:46:12) - Yeah, we went way, way back, we're in sparta. Or you know, like fucking, like marie antoinette is like fucking, you know, king richard, and you never know what. How do you know that she was like, oh, yeah, i don't think that. Frank (00:46:25) - I mean, i think the sound is innate. Joe (00:46:27) - I think that they play it up, but i do think the sound is innate, is it? Yeah, is it? I think what have you ever felt good to the point that you've made like a moaning sound, like peeing, really like, oh, so like relief. So that's what sex is: relief. It's not enjoyment, i mean, no, it's enjoyment, but it's like there is, there's a big relief. There's a big relief when i get enjoyed. I'm like, when i'm happy, i'm like, yeah, let's go. Frank (00:46:53) - You know like i like i'm like very pumped, yeah, but i'm not like excited when having- why not, you should be, it's not like. It's not like excited like whoa, like i'm on a roller coaster. Joe (00:47:02) - It's a different kind of. Frank (00:47:03) - There's more like anger, yes, but i think that a lot of like what people expect the sounds to be during sex now are from porn. Like the girls like needs to be, like, oh yeah, the guy needs to be like spa, senpai, senpai, muddle, my pp, senpai, i do think. But like, how do we know, like, what noises kim kardashian's making on? Joe (00:47:33) - I mean, we know roller coaster, we know what kind of noise she's making during sex that we do? Frank (00:47:36) - Well, we don't know. That might have been a show. I think we know that might have been a show. I don't know, i don't know, i'm not gonna. She might have changed. She might have changed through the years. She might have matured. Joe (00:47:45) - I might have went from a to like a- yeah, one of those is way more mature than the other. I was gonna say that's the, that's the progression there. That's the progress. What's the ultimate mature noise? Whoa, you want to be having sex with a woman. And they go: whoa, think about that. Frank (00:48:04) - Like, how impressed, like is impressed enough during, maybe afterwards, wow, maybe afterwards. No, like in it, like, oh my god, whoa, that's fucking dope, that's so. That's the ultimate fucking sign of respect. No, you know, that's like the purple, the purple heart of sex. You just gotta go. Joe (00:48:22) - Whoa, i no, not for me, i think so, not for me. Frank (00:48:26) - But on the roller coaster you're getting noises that you never, you didn't, you never knew. Joe (00:48:31) - Dude, oh my god, that's such a funny part of uh dating is like you meet a person and like they're visually appealing and you hang out with them for like the first 15 minutes you're like this is great, but then you just wait and you find the thing, you find it, and sometimes it's like they're laughing. Frank (00:48:49) - It's like, oh, you're like i have to go, not even just a laugh, but it's like when something stupid happens, like they trip, and they're like, oh, and it's like that's, that's the worst one, because that there's no coming back from. Yeah, it's like the snl skit. Uh, you remember when? Uh, you know what wig? Joe (00:49:06) - Go ahead, it's your, your show. Frank (00:49:08) - I was gonna say: you know what bothers me a lot: go ahead when someone finds something so funny that I don't that like something that would make you go, but they're like dying, laughing. I'm like I get so mad chill out. Joe (00:49:24) - It bothers me so much. Yeah, I don't know why. Frank (00:49:27) - Yeah, I can see that if I was on a date with someone and something happened like they like tripped or something, I bet, oh, okay, like, okay, like whatever, and it's like I just I just like my, it's alright, my grandma fell down, it's okay, like you can just walk away at that point, yeah, I'd like not that funny guys, please stop it. Joe (00:49:48) - No, I am right, I am right there with or like if they. I remember I I had, like years and years and years ago, dated a girl who, like it wasn't her laugh, that was annoying, but like before she laughs, she was like I was like, Oh, silent, oh no, the sign I remember being like, no, coming back from this, or snorting, snorting's crazy, it's not bad, cuz I snort sometimes. Frank (00:50:13) - Well, yeah, like sometimes, but to have like a consistent snort, I mean like every time, it's like like just constantly. Joe (00:50:18) - Yeah, I'd get them a fucking like breathing strip or something. Yeah, I think you might have sleep. Yeah, I'd get him the mask and be like yo, chill out so you have laugh apnea. Yeah, but hey, man, if he is dating Kim Kardashian, good for him, good for them, kudos, she just hosted SNL. I feel like that's where he meets most of these people. Frank (00:50:38) - Oh yeah, because like that's all you need I'll tell you. Joe (00:50:41) - And like what, what is it about him, though? Like he's got to be like the most fucking, like charming. Frank (00:50:46) - I think that he's funny. Joe (00:50:47) - Like he's got to be like hilarious behind this. Frank (00:50:49) - I think from the outside, looking in, I think he just has a lot of like like humility, like he's like a celebrity. He's like a very big celebrity now, but he's not like he doesn't move that way, he doesn't give a fuck, yeah. So I think that's attractive to people, especially in industry, where people like really care about image, really care about whatever, and he's just like: not that. Joe (00:51:10) - Yeah, I think it also could be. I think, like the trend is he's also not like super tattooed bad white boy. Yeah, I mean Fox MGK, her sister- yeah, which one is the sister? Travis Barker and courtney Chloe, Courtney, Courtney and Travis Barker. Herbie Davidson- yeah, who's next? Who's like a super tattooed white. Oh, these are the island boys they're gonna be dating like Megan, Thee Stallion and Saweetie. That's the only two like current, like female rappers that I know of. But, yeah, good for you. Frank (00:51:49) - I mean, you know, you know I'm saying I wish all the happiness in the world- I really do. Joe (00:51:52) - And when they want to hang out with me, also, like Pete, I feel like Pete David's got. He's gotten better looking as the years have gone on. Frank (00:52:01) - You can argue. So what wrote an article. It was like Pete Davidson is butthole eyes and like Ariana Grande came out, was like it's cuz, he has an autoimmune disease. And like people were like, hey, I got one too, don't have butthole. Yeah, it's true, he's like. When I close my eyes I see, like him, the lead singer, the gorillas, Jack Skellington- I don't even know what they look like that. Like the lead singer, the girls, like the animated- oh, you know, like the teeth are all got parts in it. I'm like there's like they're white. Frank (00:52:37) - Yeah, you know, Jack Skellington, anyone that lives or works in Hot Topic. You know those types. Joe (00:52:44) - Hmm, I don't know. Frank (00:52:45) - I like wearing a Misfits t-shirt. I don't. Joe (00:52:48) - I don't necessarily not to get the the appeal of Pete Davidson, but on this level, I don't think anyone could have foreseen this. Frank (00:52:56) - Listen, we were really thrown for a hloop with Ariana Grande. Joe (00:53:01) - Well, I mean that's. I mean that's different though, because like they're the same age. She dated Mac Miller and like he's a like he's, he was a very likable dude, yeah, but like it wasn't, like that was like I think that was people like saw, that is like his ceiling, like she's a huge star, she is such a massive star. Frank (00:53:19) - Well, also like, okay, no one's like, oh, my god, Kate Beckinsale- they're saying that because that she's like quite a couple years older than him. She's beautiful. Kim K's might be older than her. Kim Kardashian, you think, is older than Kate Beckinsale, bro. Joe (00:53:32) - How long is Kate Beckinsale? Frank (00:53:33) - She's got to be in her late 40s. Joe (00:53:35) - Maybe kim K is, like, I think, just pushing 40. Maybe what kate, Kate Beckinsale, bro, this woman is- might be one of the most attractive people all time. Frank (00:53:48) - Then beautiful 48. Joe (00:53:50) - Kim is 41. Okay, yeah, but still like yo, you're, you're for, I think, because like he was dating Kate Beckinsale and he was like 25. Well, I think he's my age. Frank (00:54:00) - No, I think he's a year younger than I said. Joe (00:54:02) - Why we're the same age. Frank (00:54:03) - I think he's a year younger than us, so is he 29?? Joe (00:54:08) - I thought he was.
